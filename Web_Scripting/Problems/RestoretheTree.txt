Petya had a tree consisting of n vertices numbered with integers from 1 to n. Accidentally he lost his tree. Petya remembers information about k vertices: distances from each of them to each of the n tree vertices.Your task is to restore any tree that satisfies the information that Petya remembers or report that such tree doesn't exist.
