Alice and Bob are playing a game. They start with a positive integer n and take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can subtract from n one of its divisors that isn't 1 or n. The player who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first.Note that they subtract a divisor of the current number in each turn.You are asked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally.
