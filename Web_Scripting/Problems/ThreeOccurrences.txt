You are given an array a consisting of n integers. We denote the subarray a[l..r] as the array [a_l, a_{l + 1}, \dots, a_r] (1 \le l \le r \le n).A subarray is considered good if every integer that occurs in this subarray occurs there exactly thrice. For example, the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2] has three good subarrays:  a[1..6] = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1];  a[2..4] = [2, 2, 2];  a[7..9] = [2, 2, 2]. Calculate the number of good subarrays of the given array a.
