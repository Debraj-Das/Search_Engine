Reziba has many magic gems. Each magic gem can be split into M normal gems. The amount of space each magic (and normal) gem takes is 1 unit. A normal gem cannot be split.Reziba wants to choose a set of magic gems and split some of them, so the total space occupied by the resulting set of gems is N units. If a magic gem is chosen and split, it takes M units of space (since it is split into M gems); if a magic gem is not split, it takes 1 unit.How many different configurations of the resulting set of gems can Reziba have, such that the total amount of space taken is N units? Print the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7). Two configurations are considered different if the number of magic gems Reziba takes to form them differs, or the indices of gems Reziba has to split differ.
