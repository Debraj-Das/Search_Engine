The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.You are given n segments on the coordinate axis OX. Segments can intersect, lie inside each other and even coincide. The i-th segment is [l_i; r_i] (l_i \le r_i) and it covers all integer points j such that l_i \le j \le r_i.The integer point is called bad if it is covered by strictly more than k segments.Your task is to remove the minimum number of segments so that there are no bad points at all.
