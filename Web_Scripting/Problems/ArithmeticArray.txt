An array b of length k is called good if its arithmetic mean is equal to 1. More formally, if \frac{b_1 + \cdots + b_k}{k}=1.Note that the value \frac{b_1+\cdots+b_k}{k} is not rounded up or down. For example, the array [1,1,1,2] has an arithmetic mean of 1.25, which is not equal to 1.You are given an integer array a of length n. In an operation, you can append a non-negative integer to the end of the array. What's the minimum number of operations required to make the array good?We have a proof that it is always possible with finitely many operations.
