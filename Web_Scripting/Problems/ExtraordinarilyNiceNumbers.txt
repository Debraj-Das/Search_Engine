The positive integer a is a divisor of the positive integer b if and only if there exists a positive integer c such that acb King Astyages thinks a positive integer x is extraordinarily nice if the number of its even divisors is equal to the number of its odd divisorsFor example 3 has two positive divisors 3 and 1 both of which are odd so 3 is not extraordinarily nice On the other hand 2 is only divisible by 2 and 1 so it has one odd and one even divisor Therefore 2 is extraordinarily niceGiven a positive integer x determine whether its extraordinarily nice
