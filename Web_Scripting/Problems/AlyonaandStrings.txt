After returned from forest Alyona started reading a book She noticed strings s and t lengths of which are n and m respectively As usual reading bored Alyona and she decided to pay her attention to strings s and t which she considered very similarAlyona has her favourite positive integer k and because she is too small k does not exceed 10 The girl wants now to choose k disjoint nonempty substrings of string s such that these strings appear as disjoint substrings of string t and in the same order as they do in string s She is also interested in that their length is maximum possible among all variantsFormally Alyona wants to find a sequence of k nonempty strings p1p2p3pk satisfying following conditions  s can be represented as concatenation a1p1a2p2 akpkak1 where a1a2ak1 is a sequence of arbitrary strings some of them may be possibly empty  t can be represented as concatenation b1p1b2p2 bkpkbk1 where b1b2bk1 is a sequence of arbitrary strings some of them may be possibly empty  sum of the lengths of strings in sequence is maximum possible Please help Alyona solve this complicated problem and find at least the sum of the lengths of the strings in a desired sequenceA substring of a string is a subsequence of consecutive characters of the string
