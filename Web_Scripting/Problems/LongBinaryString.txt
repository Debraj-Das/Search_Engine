There is a binary string t of length 10^{100}, and initally all of its bits are \texttt{0}. You are given a binary string s, and perform the following operation some times:   Select some substring of t, and replace it with its XOR with s.^\dagger  After several operations, the string t has exactly two bits \texttt{1}; that is, there are exactly two distinct indices p and q such that the p-th and q-th bits of t are \texttt{1}, and the rest of the bits are \texttt{0}. Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger string t satisfying these constraints, or report that no such string exists.^\dagger Formally, choose an index i such that 0 \leq i \leq 10^{100}-|s|. For all 1 \leq j \leq |s|, if s_j = \texttt{1}, then toggle t_{i+j}. That is, if t_{i+j}=\texttt{0}, set t_{i+j}=\texttt{1}. Otherwise if t_{i+j}=\texttt{1}, set t_{i+j}=\texttt{0}.^\ddagger A binary string a is lexicographically larger than a binary string b of the same length if in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a bit \texttt{1} and the corresponding bit in b is \texttt{0}.
