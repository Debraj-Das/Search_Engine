You have n gifts and you want to give all of them to children. Of course, you don't want to offend anyone, so all gifts should be equal between each other. The i-th gift consists of a_i candies and b_i oranges.During one move, you can choose some gift 1 \le i \le n and do one of the following operations:  eat exactly one candy from this gift (decrease a_i by one);  eat exactly one orange from this gift (decrease b_i by one);  eat exactly one candy and exactly one orange from this gift (decrease both a_i and b_i by one). Of course, you can not eat a candy or orange if it's not present in the gift (so neither a_i nor b_i can become less than zero).As said above, all gifts should be equal. This means that after some sequence of moves the following two conditions should be satisfied: a_1 = a_2 = \dots = a_n and b_1 = b_2 = \dots = b_n (and a_i equals b_i is not necessary).Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts.You have to answer t independent test cases.
