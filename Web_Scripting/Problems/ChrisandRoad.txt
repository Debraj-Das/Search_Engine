And while Mishka is enjoying her tripChris is a little brown bear No one knows where and when he met Mishka but for a long time they are together excluding her current trip However best friends are important too John is Chris best friendOnce walking with his friend John gave Chris the following problemAt the infinite horizontal road of width w bounded by lines y0 and yw there is a bus moving presented as a convex polygon of n vertices The bus moves continuously with a constant speed of v in a straight Ox line in direction of decreasing x coordinates thus in time only x coordinates of its points are changing Formally after time t each of x coordinates of its points will be decreased by vtThere is a pedestrian in the point 00 who can move only by a vertical pedestrian crossing presented as a segment connecting points 00 and 0w with any speed not exceeding u Thus the pedestrian can move only in a straight line Oy in any direction with any speed not exceeding u and not leaving the road borders The pedestrian can instantly change his speed thus for example he can stop instantlyPlease look at the sample note picture for better understandingWe consider the pedestrian is hit by the bus if at any moment the point he is located in lies strictly inside the bus polygon this means that if the point lies on the polygon vertex or on its edge the pedestrian is not hit by the busYou are given the bus position at the moment 0 Please help Chris determine minimum amount of time the pedestrian needs to cross the road and reach the point 0w and not to be hit by the bus
