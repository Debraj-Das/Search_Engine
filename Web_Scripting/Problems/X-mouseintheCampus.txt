The campus has m rooms numbered from 0 to m - 1. Also the x-mouse lives in the campus. The x-mouse is not just a mouse: each second x-mouse moves from room i to the room i \cdot x \mod{m} (in fact, it teleports from one room to another since it doesn't visit any intermediate room). Starting position of the x-mouse is unknown.You are responsible to catch the x-mouse in the campus, so you are guessing about minimum possible number of traps (one trap in one room) you need to place. You are sure that if the x-mouse enters a trapped room, it immediately gets caught.And the only observation you made is \text{GCD} (x, m) = 1.
