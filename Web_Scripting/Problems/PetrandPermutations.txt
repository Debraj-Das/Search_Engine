Petr likes to come up with problems about randomly generated data. This time problem is about random permutation. He decided to generate a random permutation this way: he takes identity permutation of numbers from 1 to n and then 3n times takes a random pair of different elements and swaps them. Alex envies Petr and tries to imitate him in all kind of things. Alex has also come up with a problem about random permutation. He generates a random permutation just like Petr but swaps elements 7n+1 times instead of 3n times. Because it is more random, OK?!You somehow get a test from one of these problems and now you want to know from which one.
