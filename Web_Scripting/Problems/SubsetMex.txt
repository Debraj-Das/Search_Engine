Given a set of integers (it can contain equal elements).You have to split it into two subsets A and B (both of them can contain equal elements or be empty). You have to maximize the value of mex(A)+mex(B).Here mex of a set denotes the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't exist in the set. For example:   mex(\{1,4,0,2,2,1\})=3  mex(\{3,3,2,1,3,0,0\})=4  mex(\varnothing)=0 (mex for empty set) The set is splitted into two subsets A and B if for any integer number x the number of occurrences of x into this set is equal to the sum of the number of occurrences of x into A and the number of occurrences of x into B.
