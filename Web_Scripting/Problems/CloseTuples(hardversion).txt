This is the hard version of this problem. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the constraints on k and m. In this version of the problem, you need to output the answer by modulo 10^9+7.You are given a sequence a of length n consisting of integers from 1 to n. The sequence may contain duplicates (i.e. some elements can be equal).Find the number of tuples of m elements such that the maximum number in the tuple differs from the minimum by no more than k. Formally, you need to find the number of tuples of m indices i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_m, such that\max(a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots, a_{i_m}) - \min(a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots, a_{i_m}) \le k.For example, if n=4, m=3, k=2, a=[1,2,4,3], then there are two such triples (i=1, j=2, z=4 and i=2, j=3, z=4). If n=4, m=2, k=1, a=[1,1,1,1], then all six possible pairs are suitable.As the result can be very large, you should print the value modulo 10^9 + 7 (the remainder when divided by 10^9 + 7).
