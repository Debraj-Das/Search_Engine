Suppose you had an array A of n elements, each of which is 0 or 1.Let us define a function f(k,A) which returns another array B, the result of sorting the first k elements of A in non-decreasing order. For example, f(4,[0,1,1,0,0,1,0]) = [0,0,1,1,0,1,0]. Note that the first 4 elements were sorted.Now consider the arrays B_1, B_2,\ldots, B_n generated by f(1,A), f(2,A),\ldots,f(n,A). Let C be the array obtained by taking the element-wise sum of B_1, B_2,\ldots, B_n.For example, let A=[0,1,0,1]. Then we have B_1=[0,1,0,1], B_2=[0,1,0,1], B_3=[0,0,1,1], B_4=[0,0,1,1]. Then C=B_1+B_2+B_3+B_4=[0,1,0,1]+[0,1,0,1]+[0,0,1,1]+[0,0,1,1]=[0,2,2,4].You are given C. Determine a binary array A that would give C when processed as above. It is guaranteed that an array A exists for given C in the input.
