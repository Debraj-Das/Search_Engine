Ivan plays some computer game. There are n quests in the game. Each quest can be upgraded once, this increases the reward for its completion. Each quest has 3 parameters a_{i}, b_{i}, p_{i}: reward for completing quest before upgrade, reward for completing quest after upgrade (a_{i} < b_{i}) and probability of successful completing the quest.Each second Ivan can try to complete one quest and he will succeed with probability p_{i}. In case of success Ivan will get the reward and opportunity to upgrade any one quest (not necessary the one he just completed). In case of failure he gets nothing. Quests do not vanish after completing.Ivan has t seconds. He wants to maximize expected value of his total gain after t seconds. Help him to calculate this value.
