Goauld Apophis captured Jack ONeills team again Jack himself was able to escape but by that time Apophiss ship had already jumped to hyperspace But Jack knows on what planet will Apophis land In order to save his friends Jack must repeatedly go through stargates to get to this planetOverall the galaxy has n planets indexed with numbers from 1 to n Jack is on the planet with index 1 and Apophis will land on the planet with index n Jack can move between some pairs of planets through stargates he can move in both directions the transfer takes a positive and perhaps for different pairs of planets unequal number of seconds Jack begins his journey at time 0It can be that other travellers are arriving to the planet where Jack is currently located In this case Jack has to wait for exactly 1 second before he can use the stargate That is if at time t another traveller arrives to the planet Jack can only pass through the stargate at time t1 unless there are more travellers arriving at time t1 to the same planetKnowing the information about travel times between the planets and the times when Jack would not be able to use the stargate on particular planets determine the minimum time in which he can get to the planet with index n
