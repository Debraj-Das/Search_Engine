Evlampiy was gifted a rooted tree. The vertices of the tree are numbered from 1 to n. Each of its vertices also has an integer a_i written on it. For each vertex i, Evlampiy calculated c_i — the number of vertices j in the subtree of vertex i, such that a_j < a_i. Illustration for the second example, the first integer is a_i and the integer in parentheses is c_iAfter the new year, Evlampiy could not remember what his gift was! He remembers the tree and the values of c_i, but he completely forgot which integers a_i were written on the vertices.Help him to restore initial integers!
