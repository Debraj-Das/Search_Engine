Vanya loves playing He even has a special set of cards to play with Each card has a single integer The number on the card can be positive negative and can even be equal to zero The only limit is the number on each card doesnt exceed x in the absolute valueNatasha doesnt like when Vanya spends a long time playing so she hid all of his cards Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them Vanya loves the balance so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero On the other hand he got very tired of looking for cards Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zeroYou can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from x to x
