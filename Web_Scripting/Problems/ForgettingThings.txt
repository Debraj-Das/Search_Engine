Kolya is very absent-minded. Today his math teacher asked him to solve a simple problem with the equation a + 1 = b with positive integers a and b, but Kolya forgot the numbers a and b. He does, however, remember that the first (leftmost) digit of a was d_a, and the first (leftmost) digit of b was d_b.Can you reconstruct any equation a + 1 = b that satisfies this property? It may be possible that Kolya misremembers the digits, and there is no suitable equation, in which case report so.
