Little boy Valera studies an algorithm of sorting an integer array After studying the theory he went on to the practical tasks As a result he wrote a program that sorts an array of n integers a1a2an in the nondecreasing order The pseudocode of the program written by Valera is given below The input of the program gets number n and array aloop integer variable i from 1 to n1loop integer variable j from i to n1if ajaj1 then swap the values of elements aj and aj1But Valera could have made a mistake because he hasnt yet fully learned the sorting algorithm If Valera made a mistake in his program you need to give a counterexample that makes his program work improperly that is the example that makes the program sort the array not in the nondecreasing order If such example for the given value of n doesnt exist print 1
