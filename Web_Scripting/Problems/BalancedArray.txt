You are given a positive integer n, it is guaranteed that n is even (i.e. divisible by 2).You want to construct the array a of length n such that:   The first \frac{n}{2} elements of a are even (divisible by 2);  the second \frac{n}{2} elements of a are odd (not divisible by 2);  all elements of a are distinct and positive;  the sum of the first half equals to the sum of the second half (\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{2}} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=\frac{n}{2} + 1}^{n} a_i). If there are multiple answers, you can print any. It is not guaranteed that the answer exists.You have to answer t independent test cases.
