Little Petya likes arrays that consist of non-negative integers a lot. Recently his mom has presented him one such array consisting of n elements. Petya immediately decided to find there a segment of consecutive elements, such that the xor of all numbers from this segment was maximal possible. Help him with that.The xor operation is the bitwise exclusive "OR", that is denoted as "xor" in Pascal and "^" in C/C++/Java.
