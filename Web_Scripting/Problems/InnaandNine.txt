Inna loves digit 9 very much Thats why she asked Dima to write a small number consisting of nines But Dima must have misunderstood her and he wrote a very large number a consisting of digits from 1 to 9Inna wants to slightly alter the number Dima wrote so that in the end the number contained as many digits nine as possible In one move Inna can choose two adjacent digits in a number which sum equals 9 and replace them by a single digit 9For instance Inna can alter number 14545181 like this 14545181194518119451919919 Also she can use this method to transform number 14545181 into number 19991 Inna will not transform it into 149591 as she can get numbers 19919 and 19991 which contain more digits nineDima is a programmer so he wants to find out how many distinct numbers containing as many digits nine as possible Inna can get from the written number Help him with this challenging task
