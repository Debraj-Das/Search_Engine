Roman planted a tree consisting of n vertices Each vertex contains a lowercase English letter Vertex 1 is the root of the tree each of the n1 remaining vertices has a parent in the tree Vertex is connected with its parent by an edge The parent of vertex i is vertex pi the parent index is always less than the index of the vertex ie piiThe depth of the vertex is the number of nodes on the path from the root to v along the edges In particular the depth of the root is equal to 1We say that vertex u is in the subtree of vertex v if we can get from u to v moving from the vertex to the parent In particular vertex v is in its subtreeRoma gives you m queries the ith of which consists of two numbers vi hi Lets consider the vertices in the subtree vi located at depth hi Determine whether you can use the letters written at these vertices to make a string that is a palindrome The letters that are written in the vertexes can be rearranged in any order to make a palindrome but all letters should be used
