You are given matrix a of size nm its elements are integers We will assume that the rows of the matrix are numbered from top to bottom from 1 to n the columns are numbered from left to right from 1 to m We will denote the element on the intersecting of the ith row and the jth column as aijWell call submatrix i1j1i2j2 1i1i2n1j1j2m such elements aij of the given matrix that i1ii2 AND j1jj2 Well call the area of the submatrix number i2i11j2j11 Well call a submatrix inhomogeneous if all its elements are distinctFind the largest in area inhomogenous submatrix of the given matrix
