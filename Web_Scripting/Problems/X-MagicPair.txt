You are given a pair of integers (a, b) and an integer x.You can change the pair in two different ways:   set (assign) a := |a - b|;  set (assign) b := |a - b|,  where |a - b| is the absolute difference between a and b.The pair (a, b) is called x-magic if x is obtainable either as a or as b using only the given operations (i.e. the pair (a, b) is x-magic if a = x or b = x after some number of operations applied). You can apply the operations any number of times (even zero).Your task is to find out if the pair (a, b) is x-magic or not.You have to answer t independent test cases.
