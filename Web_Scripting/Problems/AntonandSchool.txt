Anton goes to school, his favorite lessons are arraystudying. He usually solves all the tasks pretty fast, but this time the teacher gave him a complicated one: given two arrays b and c of length n, find array a, such that:where a and b means bitwise AND, while a or b means bitwise OR.Usually Anton is good in arraystudying, but this problem is too hard, so Anton asks you to help.
