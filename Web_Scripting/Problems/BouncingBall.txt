You're creating a game level for some mobile game. The level should contain some number of cells aligned in a row from left to right and numbered with consecutive integers starting from 1, and in each cell you can either put a platform or leave it empty.In order to pass a level, a player must throw a ball from the left so that it first lands on a platform in the cell p, then bounces off it, then bounces off a platform in the cell (p + k), then a platform in the cell (p + 2k), and so on every k-th platform until it goes farther than the last cell. If any of these cells has no platform, you can't pass the level with these p and k.You already have some level pattern a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n, where a_i = 0 means there is no platform in the cell i, and a_i = 1 means there is one. You want to modify it so that the level can be passed with given p and k. In x seconds you can add a platform in some empty cell. In y seconds you can remove the first cell completely, reducing the number of cells by one, and renumerating the other cells keeping their order. You can't do any other operation. You can not reduce the number of cells to less than p.  Illustration for the third example test case. Crosses mark deleted cells. Blue platform is the newly added. What is the minimum number of seconds you need to make this level passable with given p and k?
