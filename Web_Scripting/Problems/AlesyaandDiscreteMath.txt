divide and conquer

We call a function good if its domain of definition is some set of integers and if in case it's defined in x and x-1, f(x) = f(x-1) + 1 or f(x) = f(x-1).Tanya has found n good functions f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n}, which are defined on all integers from 0 to 10^{18} and f_i(0) = 0 and f_i(10^{18}) = L for all i from 1 to n. It's an notorious coincidence that n is a divisor of L. She suggests Alesya a game. Using one question Alesya can ask Tanya a value of any single function in any single point. To win Alesya must choose integers l_{i} and r_{i} (0 \leq l_{i} \leq r_{i} \leq 10^{18}), such that f_{i}(r_{i}) - f_{i}(l_{i}) \geq \frac{L}{n} (here f_i(x) means the value of i-th function at point x) for all i such that 1 \leq i \leq n so that for any pair of two functions their segments [l_i, r_i] don't intersect (but may have one common point).Unfortunately, Tanya doesn't allow to make more than 2 \cdot 10^{5} questions. Help Alesya to win!It can be proved that it's always possible to choose [l_i, r_i] which satisfy the conditions described above.It's guaranteed, that Tanya doesn't change functions during the game, i.e. interactor is not adaptive
