During the Russian Code Cup programming competition the testing system stores all sent solutions for each participant We know that many participants use random numbers in their programs and are often sent several solutions with the same source code to checkEach participant is identified by some unique positive integer k and each sent solution A is characterized by two numbers x the number of different solutions that are sent before the first solution identical to A and k  the number of the participant who is the author of the solution Consequently all identical solutions have the same xIt is known that the data in the testing system are stored in the chronological order that is if the testing system has a solution with number x x0 of the participant with number k then the testing system has a solution with number x1 of the same participant stored somewhere beforeDuring the competition the checking system crashed but then the data of the submissions of all participants have been restored Now the jury wants to verify that the recovered data is in chronological order Help the jury to do so
