Berland has managed to repel the flatlanders' attack and is now starting the counter attack.Flatland has n cities, numbered from 1 to n, and some pairs of them are connected by bidirectional roads. The Flatlandian maps show roads between cities if and only if there is in fact no road between this pair of cities (we do not know whether is it a clever spy-proof strategy or just saving ink). In other words, if two cities are connected by a road on a flatland map, then there is in fact no road between them. The opposite situation is also true: if two cities are not connected by a road on a flatland map, then in fact, there is a road between them.The berlanders got hold of a flatland map. Now Vasya the Corporal is commissioned by General Touristov to find all such groups of flatland cities, that in each group of cities you can get from any city to any other one, moving along the actual roads. Also the cities from different groups are unreachable from each other, moving along the actual roads. Indeed, destroying such groups one by one is much easier than surrounding all Flatland at once!Help the corporal complete this task and finally become a sergeant! Don't forget that a flatland map shows a road between cities if and only if there is in fact no road between them.
