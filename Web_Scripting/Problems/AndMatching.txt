You are given a set of n (n is always a power of 2) elements containing all integers 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 exactly once.Find \frac{n}{2} pairs of elements such that:  Each element in the set is in exactly one pair.  The sum over all pairs of the bitwise AND of its elements must be exactly equal to k. Formally, if a_i and b_i are the elements of the i-th pair, then the following must hold: \sum_{i=1}^{n/2}{a_i \& b_i} = k, where \& denotes the bitwise AND operation. If there are many solutions, print any of them, if there is no solution, print -1 instead.
