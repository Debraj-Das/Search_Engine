Alice and Bob play a game. They have a set that initially consists of n integers. The game is played in k turns. During each turn, the following events happen:  firstly, Alice chooses an integer from the set. She can choose any integer except for the maximum one. Let the integer chosen by Alice be a;  secondly, Bob chooses an integer from the set. He can choose any integer that is greater than a. Let the integer chosen by Bob be b;  finally, both a and b are erased from the set, and the value of b - a is added to the score of the game. Initially, the score is 0. Alice wants to maximize the resulting score, Bob wants to minimize it. Assuming that both Alice and Bob play optimally, calculate the resulting score of the game.
