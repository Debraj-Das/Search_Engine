You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n and an array b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n.For one operation you can sort in non-decreasing order any subarray a[l \dots r] of the array a.For example, if a = [4, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1] and you choose subbarray a[2 \dots 5], then the array turns into [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]. You are asked to determine whether it is possible to obtain the array b by applying this operation any number of times (possibly zero) to the array a.
