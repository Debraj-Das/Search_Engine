Given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 1000). Find the maximum value of i + j such that a_i and a_j are coprime,^{\dagger} or -1 if no such i, j exist.For example consider the array [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 7, 7]. The maximum value of i + j that can be obtained is 5 + 7, since a_5 = 4 and a_7 = 7 are coprime.^{\dagger} Two integers p and q are coprime if the only positive integer that is a divisor of both of them is 1 (that is, their greatest common divisor is 1).
