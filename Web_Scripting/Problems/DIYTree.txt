  William really likes puzzle kits. For one of his birthdays, his friends gifted him a complete undirected edge-weighted graph consisting of n vertices.He wants to build a spanning tree of this graph, such that for the first k vertices the following condition is satisfied: the degree of a vertex with index i does not exceed d_i. Vertices from k + 1 to n may have any degree.William wants you to find the minimum weight of a spanning tree that satisfies all the conditions.A spanning tree is a subset of edges of a graph that forms a tree on all n vertices of the graph. The weight of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of weights of all the edges included in a spanning tree.
