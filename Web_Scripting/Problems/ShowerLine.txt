Many students live in a dormitory A dormitory is a whole new world of funny amusements and possibilities but it does have its drawbacks There is only one shower and there are multiple students who wish to have a shower in the morning Thats why every morning there is a line of five people in front of the dormitory shower door As soon as the shower opens the first person from the line enters the shower After a while the first person leaves the shower and the next person enters the shower The process continues until everybody in the line has a showerHaving a shower takes some time so the students in the line talk as they wait At each moment of time the students talk in pairs the 2i1th man in the line for the current moment talks with the 2ith one Lets look at this process in more detail Lets number the people from 1 to 5 Lets assume that the line initially looks as 23154 person number 2 stands at the beginning of the line Then before the shower opens 2 talks with 3 1 talks with 5 4 doesnt talk with anyone Then 2 enters the shower While 2 has a shower 3 and 1 talk 5 and 4 talk too Then 3 enters the shower While 3 has a shower 1 and 5 talk 4 doesnt talk to anyone Then 1 enters the shower and while he is there 5 and 4 talk Then 5 enters the shower and then 4 enters the showerWe know that if students i and j talk then the ith students happiness increases by gij and the jth students happiness increases by gji Your task is to find such initial order of students in the line that the total happiness of all students will be maximum in the end Please note that some pair of students may have a talk several times In the example above students 1 and 5 talk while they wait for the shower to open and while 3 has a shower
