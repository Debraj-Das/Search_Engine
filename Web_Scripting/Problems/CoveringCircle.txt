Sam started playing with round buckets in the sandbox, while also scattering pebbles. His mom decided to buy him a new bucket, so she needs to solve the following task.You are given n distinct points with integer coordinates A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n. All points were generated from the square [-10^8, 10^8] \times [-10^8, 10^8] uniformly and independently.You are given positive integers k, l, such that k \leq l \leq n. You want to select a subsegment A_i, A_{i+1}, \ldots, A_{i+l-1} of the points array (for some 1 \leq i \leq n + 1 - l), and some circle on the plane, containing \geq k points of the selected subsegment (inside or on the border).What is the smallest possible radius of that circle?
