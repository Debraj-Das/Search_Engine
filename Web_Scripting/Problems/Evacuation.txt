Theyve screwed something up yet again In one nuclear reactor of a research station an uncontrolled reaction is in progress and explosion which will destroy the whole station will happen soonThe station is represented by a square nn divided into 11 blocks Each block is either a reactor or a laboratory There can be several reactors and exactly one of them will explode soon The reactors can be considered impassable blocks but one can move through laboratories Between any two laboratories which are in adjacent blocks there is a corridor Blocks are considered adjacent if they have a common edgeIn each laboratory there is some number of scientists and some number of rescue capsules Once the scientist climbs into a capsule he is considered to be saved Each capsule has room for not more than one scientistThe reactor which is about to explode is damaged and a toxic coolant trickles from it into the neighboring blocks The block which contains the reactor is considered infected Every minute the coolant spreads over the laboratories through corridors If at some moment one of the blocks is infected then the next minute all the neighboring laboratories also become infected Once a lab is infected all the scientists there that are not in rescue capsules die The coolant does not spread through reactor blocksThere are exactly t minutes to the explosion Any scientist in a minute can move down the corridor to the next lab if it is not infected On any corridor an unlimited number of scientists can simultaneously move in both directions It is believed that the scientists inside a lab moves without consuming time Moreover any scientist could get into the rescue capsule instantly It is also believed that any scientist at any given moment always has the time to perform their actions move from the given laboratory into the next one or climb into the rescue capsule before the laboratory will be infectedFind the maximum number of scientists who will be able to escape
