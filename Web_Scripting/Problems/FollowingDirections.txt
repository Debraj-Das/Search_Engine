Alperen is standing at the point (0,0). He is given a string s of length n and performs n moves. The i-th move is as follows:   if s_i = \texttt{L}, then move one unit left;  if s_i = \texttt{R}, then move one unit right;  if s_i = \texttt{U}, then move one unit up;  if s_i = \texttt{D}, then move one unit down.    If Alperen starts at the center point, he can make the four moves shown.  There is a candy at (1,1) (that is, one unit above and one unit to the right of Alperen's starting point). You need to determine if Alperen ever passes the candy.   Alperen's path in the first test case.
