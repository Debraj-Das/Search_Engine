Polycarp plans to undergo a full physical examination at his local clinic. There are n doctors, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th doctor takes patients from minute L_i to minute R_i, so Polycarp can visit him at any minute in this range. It takes each doctor exactly one minute to examine Polycarp's health.Polycarp wants to arrive at the clinic at some minute x and visit all n doctors in some order without waiting or visiting any doctor several times.More formally, he chooses an integer x and a permutation p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (a sequence of n integers from 1 to n such that each integer appears exactly once), then proceeds to visit:   doctor p_1 at minute x;  doctor p_2 at minute x+1;  ...  doctor p_n at minute x+n-1. The p_i-th doctor should be able to take patients at minute x+i-1, so the following should hold: L[p_i] \le x + i - 1 \le R[p_i].Determine if it's possible for Polycarp to choose such a minute x and a permutation p that he'll be able to visit all n doctors in without waiting or visiting any doctor several times. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
