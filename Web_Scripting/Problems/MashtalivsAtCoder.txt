After many unsuccessful tries, Mashtali decided to copy modify an AtCoder problem. So here is his copied new problem:There is a tree with n vertices and some non-empty set of the vertices are pinned to the ground.Two players play a game against each other on the tree. They alternately perform the following action:  Remove an edge from the tree, then remove every connected component that has no pinned vertex.The player who cannot move loses(every edge has been deleted already). You are given the tree, but not the set of the pinned vertices. Your task is to determine, for each k, the winner of the game, if only the vertices 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k are pinned and both players play optimally.
