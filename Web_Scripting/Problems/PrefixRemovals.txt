You are given a string s consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. You must perform the following algorithm on s:  Let x be the length of the longest prefix of s which occurs somewhere else in s as a contiguous substring (the other occurrence may also intersect the prefix). If x = 0, break. Otherwise, remove the first x characters of s, and repeat. A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string "abcd" has 5 prefixes: empty string, "a", "ab", "abc" and "abcd".For instance, if we perform the algorithm on s = "abcabdc",   Initially, "ab" is the longest prefix that also appears somewhere else as a substring in s, so s = "cabdc" after 1 operation.  Then, "c" is the longest prefix that also appears somewhere else as a substring in s, so s = "abdc" after 2 operations.  Now x=0 (because there are no non-empty prefixes of "abdc" that also appear somewhere else as a substring in s), so the algorithm terminates. Find the final state of the string after performing the algorithm.
