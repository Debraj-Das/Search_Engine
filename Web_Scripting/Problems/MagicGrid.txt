Let us define a magic grid to be a square matrix of integers of size n \times n, satisfying the following conditions.   All integers from 0 to (n^2 - 1) inclusive appear in the matrix exactly once.  Bitwise XOR of all elements in a row or a column must be the same for each row and column. You are given an integer n which is a multiple of 4. Construct a magic grid of size n \times n.
