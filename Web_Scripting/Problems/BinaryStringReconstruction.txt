For some binary string s (i.e. each character s_i is either '0' or '1'), all pairs of consecutive (adjacent) characters were written. In other words, all substrings of length 2 were written. For each pair (substring of length 2), the number of '1' (ones) in it was calculated.You are given three numbers:  n_0 — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 0;  n_1 — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 1;  n_2 — the number of such pairs of consecutive characters (substrings) where the number of ones equals 2. For example, for the string s="1110011110", the following substrings would be written: "11", "11", "10", "00", "01", "11", "11", "11", "10". Thus, n_0=1, n_1=3, n_2=5.Your task is to restore any suitable binary string s from the given values n_0, n_1, n_2. It is guaranteed that at least one of the numbers n_0, n_1, n_2 is greater than 0. Also, it is guaranteed that a solution exists.
