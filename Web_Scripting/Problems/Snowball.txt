Today's morning was exceptionally snowy. Meshanya decided to go outside and noticed a huge snowball rolling down the mountain! Luckily, there are two stones on that mountain.Initially, snowball is at height h and it has weight w. Each second the following sequence of events happens: snowball's weights increases by i, where i — is the current height of snowball, then snowball hits the stone (if it's present at the current height), then snowball moves one meter down. If the snowball reaches height zero, it stops.There are exactly two stones on the mountain. First stone has weight u_1 and is located at height d_1, the second one — u_2 and d_2 respectively. When the snowball hits either of two stones, it loses weight equal to the weight of that stone. If after this snowball has negative weight, then its weight becomes zero, but the snowball continues moving as before.  Find the weight of the snowball when it stops moving, that is, it reaches height 0.
