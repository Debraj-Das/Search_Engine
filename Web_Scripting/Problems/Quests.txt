There are n quests. If you complete the i-th quest, you will gain a_i coins. You can only complete at most one quest per day. However, once you complete a quest, you cannot do the same quest again for k days. (For example, if k=2 and you do quest 1 on day 1, then you cannot do it on day 2 or 3, but you can do it again on day 4.)You are given two integers c and d. Find the maximum value of k such that you can gain at least c coins over d days. If no such k exists, output Impossible. If k can be arbitrarily large, output Infinity.
