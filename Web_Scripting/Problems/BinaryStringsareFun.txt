A binary string^\dagger b of odd length m is good if b_i is the median^\ddagger of b[1,i]^\S for all odd indices i (1 \leq i \leq m).For a binary string a of length k, a binary string b of length 2k-1 is an extension of a if b_{2i-1}=a_i for all i such that 1 \leq i \leq k. For example, 1001011 and 1101001 are extensions of the string 1001. String x=1011011 is not an extension of string y=1001 because x_3 \neq y_2. Note that there are 2^{k-1} different extensions of a.You are given a binary string s of length n. Find the sum of the number of good extensions over all prefixes of s. In other words, find \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(s[1,i]), where f(x) gives number of good extensions of string x. Since the answer can be quite large, you only need to find it modulo 998\,244\,353.^\dagger A binary string is a string whose elements are either \mathtt{0} or \mathtt{1}.^\ddagger For a binary string a of length 2m-1, the median of a is the (unique) element that occurs at least m times in a.^\S a[l,r] denotes the string of length r-l+1 which is formed by the concatenation of a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r in that order.
