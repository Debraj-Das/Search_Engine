Given a connected undirected graph with n vertices and an integer k, you have to either:  either find an independent set that has exactly \lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil vertices. or find a simple cycle of length at most k. An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. I have a proof that for any input you can always solve at least one of these problems, but it's left as an exercise for the reader.
