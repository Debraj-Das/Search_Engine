You are given an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. Also, you are given an integer k.Find either a clique of size k or a non-empty subset of vertices such that each vertex of this subset has at least k neighbors in the subset. If there are no such cliques and subsets report about it.A subset of vertices is called a clique of size k if its size is k and there exists an edge between every two vertices from the subset. A vertex is called a neighbor of the other vertex if there exists an edge between them.
