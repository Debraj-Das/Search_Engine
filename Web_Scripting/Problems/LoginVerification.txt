When registering in a social network, users are allowed to create their own convenient login to make it easier to share contacts, print it on business cards, etc.Login is an arbitrary sequence of lower and uppercase latin letters, digits and underline symbols («_»). However, in order to decrease the number of frauds and user-inattention related issues, it is prohibited to register a login if it is similar with an already existing login. More precisely, two logins s and t are considered similar if we can transform s to t via a sequence of operations of the following types:   transform lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa;  change letter «O» (uppercase latin letter) to digit «0» and vice versa;  change digit «1» (one) to any letter among «l» (lowercase latin «L»), «I» (uppercase latin «i») and vice versa, or change one of these letters to other. For example, logins «Codeforces» and «codef0rces» as well as «OO0OOO00O0OOO0O00OOO0OO_lol» and «OO0OOO0O00OOO0O00OO0OOO_1oI» are considered similar whereas «Codeforces» and «Code_forces» are not.You're given a list of existing logins with no two similar amonst and a newly created user login. Check whether this new login is similar with any of the existing ones.
