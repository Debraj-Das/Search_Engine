You are given n segments on a coordinate axis OX. The i-th segment has borders [l_i; r_i]. All points x, for which l_i \le x \le r_i holds, belong to the i-th segment.Your task is to choose the maximum by size (the number of segments) subset of the given set of segments such that each pair of segments in this subset either non-intersecting or one of them lies inside the other one.Two segments [l_i; r_i] and [l_j; r_j] are non-intersecting if they have no common points. For example, segments [1; 2] and [3; 4], [1; 3] and [5; 5] are non-intersecting, while segments [1; 2] and [2; 3], [1; 2] and [2; 2] are intersecting.The segment [l_i; r_i] lies inside the segment [l_j; r_j] if l_j \le l_i and r_i \le r_j. For example, segments [2; 2], [2, 3], [3; 4] and [2; 4] lie inside the segment [2; 4], while [2; 5] and [1; 4] are not.You have to answer t independent test cases.
