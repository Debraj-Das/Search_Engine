In Berland the opposition is going to arrange mass walking on the boulevard The boulevard consists of n tiles that are lain in a row and are numbered from 1 to n from right to left The opposition should start walking on the tile number 1 and the finish on the tile number n During the walk it is allowed to move from right to left between adjacent tiles in a row and jump over a tile More formally if you are standing on the tile number i in1 you can reach the tiles number i1 or the tile number i2 from it if you stand on the tile number n1 you can only reach tile number n We can assume that all the opposition movements occur instantaneouslyIn order to thwart an opposition rally the Berland bloody regime organized the rain The tiles on the boulevard are of poor quality and they are rapidly destroyed in the rain We know that the ith tile is destroyed after ai days of rain on day ai tile isnt destroyed yet and on day ai1 it is already destroyed Of course no one is allowed to walk on the destroyed tiles So the walk of the opposition is considered thwarted if either the tile number 1 is broken or the tile number n is broken or it is impossible to reach the tile number n from the tile number 1 if we can walk on undestroyed tilesThe opposition wants to gather more supporters for their walk Therefore the more time they have to pack the better Help the opposition to calculate how much time they still have and tell us for how many days the walk from the tile number 1 to the tile number n will be possible
