There are three sticks with integer lengths l_1, l_2 and l_3.You are asked to break exactly one of them into two pieces in such a way that:   both pieces have positive (strictly greater than 0) integer length;  the total length of the pieces is equal to the original length of the stick;  it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks such that each stick is used as exactly one of its sides. A square is also considered a rectangle.Determine if it's possible to do that.
