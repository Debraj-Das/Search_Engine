There are n houses in your city arranged on an axis at points h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n. You want to build a new house for yourself and consider two options where to place it: points p_1 and p_2.As you like visiting friends, you have calculated in advance the distances from both options to all existing houses. More formally, you have calculated two arrays d_1, d_2: d_{i, j} = \left|p_i - h_j\right|, where |x| defines the absolute value of x.After a long time of inactivity you have forgotten the locations of the houses h and the options p_1, p_2. But your diary still keeps two arrays — d_1, d_2, whose authenticity you doubt. Also, the values inside each array could be shuffled, so values at the same positions of d_1 and d_2 may correspond to different houses. Pay attention, that values from one array could not get to another, in other words, all values in the array d_1 correspond the distances from p_1 to the houses, and in the array d_2  — from p_2 to the houses.Also pay attention, that the locations of the houses h_i and the considered options p_j could match. For example, the next locations are correct: h = \{1, 0, 3, 3\}, p = \{1, 1\}, that could correspond to already shuffled d_1 = \{0, 2, 1, 2\}, d_2 = \{2, 2, 1, 0\}.Check whether there are locations of houses h and considered points p_1, p_2, for which the founded arrays of distances would be correct. If it is possible, find appropriate locations of houses and considered options.
