You are given two arrays a and b, each contains n integers.You want to create a new array c as follows: choose some real (i.e. not necessarily integer) number d, and then for every i \in [1, n] let c_i := d \cdot a_i + b_i.Your goal is to maximize the number of zeroes in array c. What is the largest possible answer, if you choose d optimally?
