Polycarpus is an amateur programmer Now he is analyzing a friends program He has already found there the function rangeIncrementl r that adds 1 to each element of some array a for all indexes in the segment lr In other words this function does the following function rangeIncrementl r    for i  l  r do        ai  ai  1Polycarpus knows the state of the array a after a series of function calls He wants to determine the minimum number of function calls that lead to such state In addition he wants to find what function calls are needed in this case It is guaranteed that the required number of calls does not exceed 105Before calls of function rangeIncrementl r all array elements equal zero
