Nezzar loves the game osu!.osu! is played on beatmaps, which can be seen as an array consisting of distinct points on a plane. A beatmap is called nice if for any three consecutive points A,B,C listed in order, the angle between these three points, centered at B, is strictly less than 90 degrees.  Points A,B,C on the left have angle less than 90 degrees, so they can be three consecutive points of a nice beatmap; Points A',B',C' on the right have angle greater or equal to 90 degrees, so they cannot be three consecutive points of a nice beatmap. Now Nezzar has a beatmap of n distinct points A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n. Nezzar would like to reorder these n points so that the resulting beatmap is nice.Formally, you are required to find a permutation p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n of integers from 1 to n, such that beatmap A_{p_1},A_{p_2},\ldots,A_{p_n} is nice. If it is impossible, you should determine it.
