Karlsson has recently discovered a huge stock of berry jam jars in the basement of the house. More specifically, there were 2n jars of strawberry and blueberry jam.All the 2n jars are arranged in a row. The stairs to the basement are exactly in the middle of that row. So when Karlsson enters the basement, he sees exactly n jars to his left and n jars to his right.For example, the basement might look like this:  Being the starightforward man he is, he immediately starts eating the jam. In one minute he chooses to empty either the first non-empty jar to his left or the first non-empty jar to his right.Finally, Karlsson decided that at the end the amount of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars should become the same.For example, this might be the result:  He has eaten 1 jar to his left and then 5 jars to his right. There remained exactly 3 full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam. Jars are numbered from 1 to 2n from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars n and n+1.What is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left?Your program should answer t independent test cases.
