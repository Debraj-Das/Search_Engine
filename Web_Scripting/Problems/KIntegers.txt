You are given a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n.In one move you can swap two adjacent values.You want to perform a minimum number of moves, such that in the end there will exist a subsegment 1,2,\ldots, k, in other words in the end there should be an integer i, 1 \leq i \leq n-k+1 such that p_i = 1, p_{i+1} = 2, \ldots, p_{i+k-1}=k.Let f(k) be the minimum number of moves that you need to make a subsegment with values 1,2,\ldots,k appear in the permutation.You need to find f(1), f(2), \ldots, f(n).
