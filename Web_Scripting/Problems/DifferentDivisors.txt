Positive integer x is called divisor of positive integer y, if y is divisible by x without remainder. For example, 1 is a divisor of 7 and 3 is not divisor of 8.We gave you an integer d and asked you to find the smallest positive integer a, such that  a has at least 4 divisors;  difference between any two divisors of a is at least d.
