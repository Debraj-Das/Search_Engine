A picture can be represented as an n\times m grid (n rows and m columns) so that each of the n \cdot m cells is colored with one color. You have k pigments of different colors. You have a limited amount of each pigment, more precisely you can color at most a_i cells with the i-th pigment.A picture is considered beautiful if each cell has at least 3 toroidal neighbors with the same color as itself.Two cells are considered toroidal neighbors if they toroidally share an edge. In other words, for some integers 1 \leq x_1,x_2 \leq n and 1 \leq y_1,y_2 \leq m, the cell in the x_1-th row and y_1-th column is a toroidal neighbor of the cell in the x_2-th row and y_2-th column if one of following two conditions holds:  x_1-x_2 \equiv \pm1 \pmod{n} and y_1=y_2, or  y_1-y_2 \equiv \pm1 \pmod{m} and x_1=x_2. Notice that each cell has exactly 4 toroidal neighbors. For example, if n=3 and m=4, the toroidal neighbors of the cell (1, 2) (the cell on the first row and second column) are: (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 3), (1, 1). They are shown in gray on the image below:  The gray cells show toroidal neighbors of (1, 2). Is it possible to color all cells with the pigments provided and create a beautiful picture?
