Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques. To transform the original message into encrypted one using key k, one has to replace each letter with a letter which is k positions later in the alphabet (if this takes the position beyond Z, the rest of it is counted from the start of the alphabet). In a more formal way, if letters of the alphabet are enumerated starting with 0, the result of encryption for character x will be  (26 is the number of letters in the Latin alphabet).You are given the original message and the encryption key k. Output the resulting cipher.
