Oleg came to see the maze of mirrors. The maze is a n by n room in which each cell is either empty or contains a mirror connecting opposite corners of this cell. Mirrors in this maze reflect light in a perfect way, which causes the interesting visual effects and contributes to the loss of orientation in the maze.Oleg is a person of curious nature, so he decided to install n lasers facing internal of the maze on the south wall of the maze. On the north wall of the maze, Oleg installed n receivers, also facing internal of the maze. Let's number lasers and receivers from west to east with distinct integers from 1 to n. Each laser sends a beam of some specific kind and receiver with number a_i should receive the beam sent from laser number i. Since two lasers' beams can't come to the same receiver, these numbers form a permutation — each of the receiver numbers occurs exactly once.You came to the maze together with Oleg. Help him to place the mirrors in the initially empty maze so that the maximum number of lasers' beams will come to the receivers they should. There are no mirrors outside the maze, so if the laser beam leaves the maze, it will not be able to go back.
