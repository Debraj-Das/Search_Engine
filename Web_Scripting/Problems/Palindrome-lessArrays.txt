Let's denote that some array b is bad if it contains a subarray b_l, b_{l+1}, \dots, b_{r} of odd length more than 1 (l < r and r - l + 1 is odd) such that \forall i \in \{0, 1, \dots, r - l\} b_{l + i} = b_{r - i}.If an array is not bad, it is good.Now you are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Some elements are replaced by -1. Calculate the number of good arrays you can obtain by replacing each -1 with some integer from 1 to k.Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 998244353.
