One day Masha was walking in the park and found a graph under a tree... Surprised? Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem...Masha has an oriented graph which i-th vertex contains some positive integer a_i. Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex u to any other vertex v such that there is an oriented edge u \to v in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex i, Masha write down an integer a_i in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly k - 1 operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.
