Edo has got a collection of n refrigerator magnetsHe decided to buy a refrigerator and hang the magnets on the door The shop can make the refrigerator with any size of the door that meets the following restrictions the refrigerator door must be rectangle and both the length and the width of the door must be positive integersEdo figured out how he wants to place the magnets on the refrigerator He introduced a system of coordinates on the plane where each magnet is represented as a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axesNow he wants to remove no more than k magnets he may choose to keep all of them and attach all remaining magnets to the refrigerator door and the area of the door should be as small as possible A magnet is considered to be attached to the refrigerator door if its center lies on the door or on its boundary The relative positions of all the remaining magnets must correspond to the planLet us explain the last two sentences Lets suppose we want to hang two magnets on the refrigerator If the magnet in the plan has coordinates of the lower left corner x1 y1 and the upper right corner x2 y2 then its center is located at   may not be integers By saying the relative position should correspond to the plan we mean that the only available operation is translation ie the vector connecting the centers of two magnets in the original plan must be equal to the vector connecting the centers of these two magnets on the refrigeratorThe sides of the refrigerator door must also be parallel to coordinate axes
