Matryoshka is a wooden toy in the form of a painted doll, inside which you can put a similar doll of a smaller size.A set of nesting dolls contains one or more nesting dolls, their sizes are consecutive positive integers. Thus, a set of nesting dolls is described by two numbers: s — the size of a smallest nesting doll in a set and m — the number of dolls in a set. In other words, the set contains sizes of s, s + 1, \dots, s + m - 1 for some integer s and m (s,m > 0).You had one or more sets of nesting dolls. Recently, you found that someone mixed all your sets in one and recorded a sequence of doll sizes — integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n.You do not remember how many sets you had, so you want to find the minimum number of sets that you could initially have.For example, if a given sequence is a=[2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]. Initially, there could be 2 sets:   the first set consisting of 4 nesting dolls with sizes [1, 2, 3, 4];  a second set consisting of 2 nesting dolls with sizes [2, 3]. According to a given sequence of sizes of nesting dolls a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, determine the minimum number of nesting dolls that can make this sequence.Each set is completely used, so all its nesting dolls are used. Each element of a given sequence must correspond to exactly one doll from some set.
