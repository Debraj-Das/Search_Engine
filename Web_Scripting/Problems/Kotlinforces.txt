Kotlinforces is a web platfrom that hosts programming competitions.The staff of Kotlinforces is asked to schedule n programming competitions on the next m days. Each competition is held in multiple stages; the regulations of the i-th competition state that this competition should consist of exactly k_i stages, and each stage, starting from the second one, should be scheduled exactly t_i days after the previous stage. In other words, if the first stage of the i-th competition is scheduled on day x, the second stage should be scheduled on day x+t_i, the third stage — on day x+2t_i, ..., the k_i-th stage (which is the last one) — on day x+(k_i-1)t_i.All n competitions should be scheduled in such a way that they start and finish during the next m days, and on any of these m days, at most one stage of one competition is held (two stages of different competitions should not be scheduled on the same day).Is it possible to schedule all n competitions to meet these constraints?
