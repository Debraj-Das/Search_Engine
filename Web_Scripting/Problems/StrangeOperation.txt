Koa the Koala has a binary string s of length n. Koa can perform no more than n-1 (possibly zero) operations of the following form:In one operation Koa selects positions i and i+1 for some i with 1 \le i < |s| and sets s_i to max(s_i, s_{i+1}). Then Koa deletes position i+1 from s (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).Note that after every operation the length of s decreases by 1.How many different binary strings can Koa obtain by doing no more than n-1 (possibly zero) operations modulo 10^9+7 (1000000007)?
