There are a lot of things which could be cut — trees, paper, "the rope". In this problem you are going to cut a sequence of integers.There is a sequence of integers, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers. Given a limited budget, you need to make maximum possible number of cuts such that each resulting segment will have the same number of odd and even integers.Cuts separate a sequence to continuous (contiguous) segments. You may think about each cut as a break between two adjacent elements in a sequence. So after cutting each element belongs to exactly one segment. Say, [4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5] \to two cuts \to [4, 1 | 2, 3, 4, 5 | 4, 4, 5, 5]. On each segment the number of even elements should be equal to the number of odd elements.The cost of the cut between x and y numbers is |x - y| bitcoins. Find the maximum possible number of cuts that can be made while spending no more than B bitcoins.
