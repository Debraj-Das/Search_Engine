An array [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m] is a palindrome, if b_i = b_{m+1-i} for each i from 1 to m. Empty array is also a palindrome.An array is called kalindrome, if the following condition holds: It's possible to select some integer x and delete some of the elements of the array equal to x, so that the remaining array (after gluing together the remaining parts) is a palindrome. Note that you don't have to delete all elements equal to x, and you don't have to delete at least one element equal to x.For example :   [1, 2, 1] is kalindrome because you can simply not delete a single element.  [3, 1, 2, 3, 1] is kalindrome because you can choose x = 3 and delete both elements equal to 3, obtaining array [1, 2, 1], which is a palindrome.  [1, 2, 3] is not kalindrome. You are given an array [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]. Determine if a is kalindrome or not.
