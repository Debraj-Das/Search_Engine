Programmers working on a large project have just received a task to write exactly m lines of code There are n programmers working on a project the ith of them makes exactly ai bugs in every line of code that he writes Lets call a sequence of nonnegative integers v1v2vn a plan if v1v2vnm The programmers follow the plan like that in the beginning the first programmer writes the first v1 lines of the given task then the second programmer writes v2 more lines of the given task and so on In the end the last programmer writes the remaining lines of the code Lets call a plan good if all the written lines of the task contain at most b bugs in totalYour task is to determine how many distinct good plans are there As the number of plans can be large print the remainder of this number modulo given positive integer mod
