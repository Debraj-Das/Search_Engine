You are given an array a of n non-negative integers, numbered from 1 to n.Let's define the cost of the array a as \displaystyle \min_{i \neq j} a_i | a_j, where | denotes the bitwise OR operation.There are q queries. For each query you are given two integers l and r (l < r). For each query you should find the cost of the subarray a_{l}, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_{r}.
