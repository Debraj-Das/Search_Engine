All cinema halls in Berland are rectangles with K rows of K seats each and K is an odd number Rows and seats are numbered from 1 to K For safety reasons people who come to the box office to buy tickets are not allowed to choose seats themselves Formerly the choice was made by a cashier but now this is the responsibility of a special seating program It was found out that the large majority of Berlands inhabitants go to the cinema in order to watch a movie thats why they want to sit as close to the hall center as possible Moreover a company of M people who come to watch a movie want necessarily to occupy M successive seats in one row Lets formulate the algorithm according to which the program chooses seats and sells tickets As the request for M seats comes the program should determine the row number x and the segment ylyr of the seats numbers in this row where yryl1M From all such possible variants as a final result the program should choose the one with the minimum function value of total seats remoteness from the center Say   the row and the seat numbers of the most central seat Then the function value of seats remoteness from the hall center is  If the amount of minimum function values is more than one the program should choose the one that is closer to the screen ie the row number x is lower If the variants are still multiple it should choose the one with the minimum yl If you did not get yet your task is to simulate the work of this program
