This is an interactive problem.There is a hidden permutation p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n. Consider an undirected graph with n nodes only with no edges. You can make two types of queries:  Specify an integer x satisfying 2 \le x \le 2n. For all integers i (1 \le i \le n) such that 1 \le x-i \le n, an edge between node i and node x-i will be added.  Query the number of edges in the shortest path between node p_i and node p_j. As the answer to this question you will get the number of edges in the shortest path if such a path exists, or -1 if there is no such path. Note that you can make both types of queries in any order.Within 2n queries (including type 1 and type 2), guess two possible permutations, at least one of which is p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n. You get accepted if at least one of the permutations is correct. You are allowed to guess the same permutation twice.A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
