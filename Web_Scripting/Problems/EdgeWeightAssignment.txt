You have unweighted tree of n vertices. You have to assign a positive weight to each edge so that the following condition would hold:  For every two different leaves v_{1} and v_{2} of this tree, bitwise XOR of weights of all edges on the simple path between v_{1} and v_{2} has to be equal to 0. Note that you can put very large positive integers (like 10^{(10^{10})}).It's guaranteed that such assignment always exists under given constraints. Now let's define f as the number of distinct weights in assignment.  In this example, assignment is valid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between every pair of leaves is 0. f value is 2 here, because there are 2 distinct edge weights(4 and 5). In this example, assignment is invalid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between vertex 1 and vertex 6 (3, 4, 5, 4) is not 0. What are the minimum and the maximum possible values of f for the given tree? Find and print both.
