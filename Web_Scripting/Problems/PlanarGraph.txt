A graph is called planar, if it can be drawn in such a way that its edges intersect only at their vertexes.An articulation point is such a vertex of an undirected graph, that when removed increases the number of connected components of the graph.A bridge is such an edge of an undirected graph, that when removed increases the number of connected components of the graph.You've got a connected undirected planar graph consisting of n vertexes, numbered from 1 to n, drawn on the plane. The graph has no bridges, articulation points, loops and multiple edges. You are also given q queries. Each query is a cycle in the graph. The query response is the number of graph vertexes, which (if you draw a graph and the cycle on the plane) are located either inside the cycle, or on it. Write a program that, given the graph and the queries, will answer each query.
