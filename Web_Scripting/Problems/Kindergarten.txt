In a kindergarten, the children are being divided into groups. The teacher put the children in a line and associated each child with his or her integer charisma value. Each child should go to exactly one group. Each group should be a nonempty segment of consecutive children of a line. A group's sociability is the maximum difference of charisma of two children in the group (in particular, if the group consists of one child, its sociability equals a zero). The teacher wants to divide the children into some number of groups in such way that the total sociability of the groups is maximum. Help him find this value.
