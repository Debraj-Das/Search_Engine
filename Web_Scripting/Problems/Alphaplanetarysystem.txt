Three planets X, Y and Z within the Alpha planetary system are inhabited with an advanced civilization. The spaceports of these planets are connected by interplanetary space shuttles. The flight scheduler should decide between 1, 2 and 3 return flights for every existing space shuttle connection. Since the residents of Alpha are strong opponents of the symmetry, there is a strict rule that any two of the spaceports connected by a shuttle must have a different number of flights. For every pair of connected spaceports, your goal is to propose a number 1, 2 or 3 for each shuttle flight, so that for every two connected spaceports the overall number of flights differs. You may assume that:1) Every planet has at least one spaceport 2) There exist only shuttle flights between spaceports of different planets 3) For every two spaceports there is a series of shuttle flights enabling traveling between them4) Spaceports are not connected by more than one shuttle
