You are given an array a consisting of n integer numbers.You have to color this array in k colors in such a way that:   Each element of the array should be colored in some color;  For each i from 1 to k there should be at least one element colored in the i-th color in the array;  For each i from 1 to k all elements colored in the i-th color should be distinct. Obviously, such coloring might be impossible. In this case, print "NO". Otherwise print "YES" and any coloring (i.e. numbers c_1, c_2, \dots c_n, where 1 \le c_i \le k and c_i is the color of the i-th element of the given array) satisfying the conditions above. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.
