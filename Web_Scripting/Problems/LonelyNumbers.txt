In number world, two different numbers are friends if they have a lot in common, but also each one has unique perks.More precisely, two different numbers a and b are friends if gcd(a,b), \frac{a}{gcd(a,b)}, \frac{b}{gcd(a,b)} can form sides of a triangle.Three numbers a, b and c can form sides of a triangle if a + b > c, b + c > a and c + a > b.In a group of numbers, a number is lonely if it doesn't have any friends in that group.Given a group of numbers containing all numbers from 1, 2, 3, ..., n, how many numbers in that group are lonely?
