Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has s burles on his card. Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number 1 \le x \le s, buy food that costs exactly x burles and obtain \lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends x burles and obtains \lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor back). The operation \lfloor\frac{a}{b}\rfloor means a divided by b rounded down.It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs x for any possible value of x.Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.For example, if Mishka has s=19 burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is 21. Firstly, he can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback. Now he has s=10 burles, so can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback and spend it too.You have to answer t independent test cases.
