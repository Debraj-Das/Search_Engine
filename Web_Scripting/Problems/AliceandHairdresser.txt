Alice's hair is growing by leaps and bounds. Maybe the cause of it is the excess of vitamins, or maybe it is some black magic...To prevent this, Alice decided to go to the hairdresser. She wants for her hair length to be at most l centimeters after haircut, where l is her favorite number. Suppose, that the Alice's head is a straight line on which n hairlines grow. Let's number them from 1 to n. With one swing of the scissors the hairdresser can shorten all hairlines on any segment to the length l, given that all hairlines on that segment had length strictly greater than l. The hairdresser wants to complete his job as fast as possible, so he will make the least possible number of swings of scissors, since each swing of scissors takes one second.Alice hasn't decided yet when she would go to the hairdresser, so she asked you to calculate how much time the haircut would take depending on the time she would go to the hairdresser. In particular, you need to process queries of two types:  0 — Alice asks how much time the haircut would take if she would go to the hairdresser now.  1 p d — p-th hairline grows by d centimeters. Note, that in the request 0 Alice is interested in hypothetical scenario of taking a haircut now, so no hairlines change their length.
