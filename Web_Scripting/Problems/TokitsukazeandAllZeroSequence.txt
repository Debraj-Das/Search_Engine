Tokitsukaze has a sequence a of length n. For each operation, she selects two numbers a_i and a_j (i \ne j; 1 \leq i,j \leq n).   If a_i = a_j, change one of them to 0.  Otherwise change both of them to \min(a_i, a_j). Tokitsukaze wants to know the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to 0. It can be proved that the answer always exists.
