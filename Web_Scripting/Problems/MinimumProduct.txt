You are given four integers a, b, x and y. Initially, a \ge x and b \ge y. You can do the following operation no more than n times:  Choose either a or b and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of a cannot become less than x, and value of b cannot become less than y. Your task is to find the minimum possible product of a and b (a \cdot b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.You have to answer t independent test cases.
