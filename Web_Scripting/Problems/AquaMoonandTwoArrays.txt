AquaMoon and Cirno are playing an interesting game with arrays. Cirno has prepared two arrays a and b, both consist of n non-negative integers. AquaMoon can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly zero):  She chooses two indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le n), then decreases the i-th element of array a by 1, and increases the j-th element of array a by 1. The resulting values at i-th and j-th index of array a are a_i - 1 and a_j + 1, respectively. Each element of array a must be non-negative after each operation. If i = j this operation doesn't change the array a. AquaMoon wants to make some operations to make arrays a and b equal. Two arrays a and b are considered equal if and only if a_i = b_i for all 1 \leq i \leq n.Help AquaMoon to find a sequence of operations that will solve her problem or find, that it is impossible to make arrays a and b equal.Please note, that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.
