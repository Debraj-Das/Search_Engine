There are n Christmas trees on an infinite number line. The i-th tree grows at the position x_i. All x_i are guaranteed to be distinct.Each integer point can be either occupied by the Christmas tree, by the human or not occupied at all. Non-integer points cannot be occupied by anything.There are m people who want to celebrate Christmas. Let y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m be the positions of people (note that all values x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m should be distinct and all y_j should be integer). You want to find such an arrangement of people that the value \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m}\min\limits_{i=1}^{n}|x_i - y_j| is the minimum possible (in other words, the sum of distances to the nearest Christmas tree for all people should be minimized).In other words, let d_j be the distance from the j-th human to the nearest Christmas tree (d_j = \min\limits_{i=1}^{n} |y_j - x_i|). Then you need to choose such positions y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m that \sum\limits_{j=1}^{m} d_j is the minimum possible.
