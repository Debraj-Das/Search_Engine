Little Petya very much likes computers Recently he has received a new Ternatron IV as a gift from his mother Unlike other modern computers Ternatron IV operates with ternary and not binary logic Petya immediately wondered how the xor operation is performed on this computer and whether there is anything like itIt turned out that the operation does exist however it is called tor and it works like this Suppose that we need to calculate the value of the expression a tor b Both numbers a and b are written in the ternary notation one under the other one b under a If they have a different number of digits then leading zeroes are added to the shorter number until the lengths are the same Then the numbers are summed together digit by digit The result of summing each two digits is calculated modulo 3 Note that there is no carry between digits i e during this operation the digits arent transferred For example 1410 tor 501001123 tor 12123102133410Petya wrote numbers a and c on a piece of paper Help him find such number b that a tor bc If there are several such numbers print the smallest one
