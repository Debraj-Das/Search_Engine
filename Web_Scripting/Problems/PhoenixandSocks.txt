To satisfy his love of matching socks, Phoenix has brought his n socks (n is even) to the sock store. Each of his socks has a color c_i and is either a left sock or right sock. Phoenix can pay one dollar to the sock store to either:   recolor a sock to any color c' (1 \le c' \le n)  turn a left sock into a right sock  turn a right sock into a left sock  The sock store may perform each of these changes any number of times. Note that the color of a left sock doesn't change when it turns into a right sock, and vice versa. A matching pair of socks is a left and right sock with the same color. What is the minimum cost for Phoenix to make n/2 matching pairs? Each sock must be included in exactly one matching pair.
