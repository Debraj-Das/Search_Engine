This is an interactive problem.You are given two integers c and n. The jury has a randomly generated set A of distinct positive integers not greater than c (it is generated from all such possible sets with equal probability). The size of A is equal to n.Your task is to guess the set A. In order to guess it, you can ask at most \lceil 0.65 \cdot c \rceil queries.In each query, you choose a single integer 1 \le x \le c. As the answer to this query you will be given the bitwise xor sum of all y, such that y \in A and gcd(x, y) = 1 (i.e. x and y are coprime). If there is no such y this xor sum is equal to 0.You can ask all queries at the beginning and you will receive the answers to all your queries. After that, you won't have the possibility to ask queries.You should find any set A', such that |A'| = n and A' and A have the same answers for all c possible queries.
