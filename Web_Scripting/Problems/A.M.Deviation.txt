A number a_2 is said to be the arithmetic mean of two numbers a_1 and a_3, if the following condition holds: a_1 + a_3 = 2\cdot a_2. We define an arithmetic mean deviation of three numbers a_1, a_2 and a_3 as follows: d(a_1, a_2, a_3) = |a_1 + a_3 - 2 \cdot a_2|.Arithmetic means a lot to Jeevan. He has three numbers a_1, a_2 and a_3 and he wants to minimize the arithmetic mean deviation d(a_1, a_2, a_3). To do so, he can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):  Choose i, j from \{1, 2, 3\} such that i \ne j and increment a_i by 1 and decrement a_j by 1 Help Jeevan find out the minimum value of d(a_1, a_2, a_3) that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.
