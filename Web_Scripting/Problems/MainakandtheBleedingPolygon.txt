Mainak has a convex polygon \mathcal P with n vertices labelled as A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n in a counter-clockwise fashion. The coordinates of the i-th point A_i are given by (x_i, y_i), where x_i and y_i are both integers.Further, it is known that the interior angle at A_i is either a right angle or a proper obtuse angle. Formally it is known that:   90 ^ \circ \le \angle A_{i - 1}A_{i}A_{i + 1} < 180 ^ \circ, \forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} where we conventionally consider A_0 = A_n and A_{n + 1} = A_1. Mainak's friend insisted that all points Q such that there exists a chord of the polygon \mathcal P passing through Q with length not exceeding 1, must be coloured \color{red}{\text{red}}. Mainak wants you to find the area of the coloured region formed by the \color{red}{\text{red}} points.Formally, determine the area of the region \mathcal S = \{Q \in \mathcal{P} | Q \text{ is coloured } \color{red}{\text{red}}\}.Recall that a chord of a polygon is a line segment between two points lying on the boundary (i.e. vertices or points on edges) of the polygon.
