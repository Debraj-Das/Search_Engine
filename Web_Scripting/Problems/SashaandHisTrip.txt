Sasha is a very happy guy, that's why he is always on the move. There are n cities in the country where Sasha lives. They are all located on one straight line, and for convenience, they are numbered from 1 to n in increasing order. The distance between any two adjacent cities is equal to 1 kilometer. Since all roads in the country are directed, it's possible to reach the city y from the city x only if x < y. Once Sasha decided to go on a trip around the country and to visit all n cities. He will move with the help of his car, Cheetah-2677. The tank capacity of this model is v liters, and it spends exactly 1 liter of fuel for 1 kilometer of the way.

Help him to figure it out!
