Recently, your friend discovered one special operation on an integer array a:   Choose two indices i and j (i \neq j);  Set a_i = a_j = |a_i - a_j|. After playing with this operation for a while, he came to the next conclusion:   For every array a of n integers, where 1 \le a_i \le 10^9, you can find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the total sum of a will decrease after performing the operation. This statement sounds fishy to you, so you want to find a counterexample for a given integer n. Can you find such counterexample and prove him wrong?In other words, find an array a consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) such that for all pairs of indices (i, j) performing the operation won't decrease the total sum (it will increase or not change the sum).
