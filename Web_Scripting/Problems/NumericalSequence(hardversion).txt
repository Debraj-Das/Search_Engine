The only difference between the easy and the hard versions is the maximum value of k.You are given an infinite sequence of form "112123123412345\dots" which consist of blocks of all consecutive positive integers written one after another. The first block consists of all numbers from 1 to 1, the second one — from 1 to 2, the third one — from 1 to 3, \dots, the i-th block consists of all numbers from 1 to i. So the first 56 elements of the sequence are "11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910". Elements of the sequence are numbered from one. For example, the 1-st element of the sequence is 1, the 3-rd element of the sequence is 2, the 20-th element of the sequence is 5, the 38-th element is 2, the 56-th element of the sequence is 0.Your task is to answer q independent queries. In the i-th query you are given one integer k_i. Calculate the digit at the position k_i of the sequence.
