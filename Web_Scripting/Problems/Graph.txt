You are given an undirected graph where each edge has one of two colors: black or red.Your task is to assign a real number to each node so that:   for each black edge the sum of values at its endpoints is 1;  for each red edge the sum of values at its endpoints is 2;  the sum of the absolute values of all assigned numbers is the smallest possible. Otherwise, if it is not possible, report that there is no feasible assignment of the numbers.
