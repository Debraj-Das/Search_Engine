Kristina had an array a of length n consisting of non-negative integers.She built a new array b of length n-1, such that b_i = \max(a_i, a_{i+1}) (1 \le i \le n-1).For example, suppose Kristina had an array a = [3, 0, 4, 0, 5] of length 5. Then she did the following:   Calculated b_1 = \max(a_1, a_2) = \max(3, 0) = 3;  Calculated b_2 = \max(a_2, a_3) = \max(0, 4) = 4;  Calculated b_3 = \max(a_3, a_4) = \max(4, 0) = 4;  Calculated b_4 = \max(a_4, a_5) = \max(0, 5) = 5.  As a result, she got an array b = [3, 4, 4, 5] of length 4.You only know the array b. Find any matching array a that Kristina may have originally had.
