After a revolution in Berland the new dictator faced an unexpected challenge: the country has to be somehow ruled. The dictator is a very efficient manager, yet he can't personally give orders to each and every citizen. That's why he decided to pick some set of leaders he would control. Those leaders will directly order the citizens. However, leadership efficiency turned out to vary from person to person (i.e. while person A makes an efficient leader, person B may not be that good at it). That's why the dictator asked world-famous berland scientists for help. The scientists suggested an innovatory technology — to make the leaders work in pairs.A relationship graph is some undirected graph whose vertices correspond to people. A simple path is a path with no repeated vertices. Long and frighteningly expensive research showed that a pair of people has maximum leadership qualities if a graph of relationships has a simple path between them with an odd number of edges. The scientists decided to call such pairs of different people leader pairs. Secret services provided the scientists with the relationship graph so that the task is simple — we have to learn to tell the dictator whether the given pairs are leader pairs or not. Help the scientists cope with the task.
