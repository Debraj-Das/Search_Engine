You are given a string s with length n-1 whose characters are either \texttt{<} or \texttt{>}.Count the permutations p_1, \, p_2, \, \dots, \, p_n of 1, \, 2, \, \dots, \, n such that, for all i = 1, \, 2, \, \dots, \, n - 1, if s_i is \texttt{<} then p_i < p_{i+1} and if s_i is \texttt{>} then p_i > p_{i+1}.Since this number can be very large, compute its logarithm in base 2.
