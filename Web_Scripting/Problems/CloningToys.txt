Imp likes his plush toy a lot.  Recently, he found a machine that can clone plush toys. Imp knows that if he applies the machine to an original toy, he additionally gets one more original toy and one copy, and if he applies the machine to a copied toy, he gets two additional copies.Initially, Imp has only one original toy. He wants to know if it is possible to use machine to get exactly x copied toys and y original toys? He can't throw toys away, and he can't apply the machine to a copy if he doesn't currently have any copies.
