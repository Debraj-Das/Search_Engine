Ghosts live in harmony and peace, they travel the space without any purpose other than scare whoever stands in their way.There are n ghosts in the universe, they move in the OXY plane, each one of them has its own velocity that does not change in time: \overrightarrow{V} = V_{x}\overrightarrow{i} + V_{y}\overrightarrow{j} where V_{x} is its speed on the x-axis and V_{y} is on the y-axis.A ghost i has experience value EX_i, which represent how many ghosts tried to scare him in his past. Two ghosts scare each other if they were in the same cartesian point at a moment of time.As the ghosts move with constant speed, after some moment of time there will be no further scaring (what a relief!) and the experience of ghost kind GX = \sum_{i=1}^{n} EX_i will never increase.Tameem is a red giant, he took a picture of the cartesian plane at a certain moment of time T, and magically all the ghosts were aligned on a line of the form y = a \cdot x + b. You have to compute what will be the experience index of the ghost kind GX in the indefinite future, this is your task for today.Note that when Tameem took the picture, GX may already be greater than 0, because many ghosts may have scared one another at any moment between [-\infty, T].
