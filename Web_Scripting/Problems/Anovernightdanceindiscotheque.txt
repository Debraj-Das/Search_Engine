The crowdedness of the discotheque would never stop our friends from having fun but a bit more spaciousness wont hurt will itThe discotheque can be seen as an infinite xyplane in which there are a total of n dancers Once someone starts moving around they will move only inside their own movement range which is a circular area Ci described by a center xiyi and a radius ri No two ranges borders have more than one common point that is for every pair ij 1ijn either ranges Ci and Cj are disjoint or one of them is a subset of the other Note that its possible that two ranges borders share a single common point but no two dancers have exactly the same rangesTsukihi being one of them defines the spaciousness to be the area covered by an odd number of movement ranges of dancers who are moving An example is shown below with shaded regions representing the spaciousness if everyone moves at the same time  But no one keeps moving for the whole night after all so the whole nights time is divided into two halves  before midnight and after midnight Every dancer moves around in one half while sitting down with friends in the other The spaciousness of two halves are calculated separately and their sum should of course be as large as possible The following figure shows an optimal solution to the example above  By different plans of who dances in the first half and who does in the other different sums of spaciousness over two halves are achieved You are to find the largest achievable value of this sum
