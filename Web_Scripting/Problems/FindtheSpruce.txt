Holidays are coming up really soon. Rick realized that it's time to think about buying a traditional spruce tree. But Rick doesn't want real trees to get hurt so he decided to find some in an n \times m matrix consisting of "*" and ".".  To find every spruce first let's define what a spruce in the matrix is. A set of matrix cells is called a spruce of height k with origin at point (x, y) if:  All cells in the set contain an "*".  For each 1 \le i \le k all cells with the row number x+i-1 and columns in range [y - i + 1, y + i - 1] must be a part of the set. All other cells cannot belong to the set.  Examples of correct and incorrect spruce trees:  Now Rick wants to know how many spruces his n \times m matrix contains. Help Rick solve this problem.
