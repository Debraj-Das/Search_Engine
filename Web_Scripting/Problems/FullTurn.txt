There are n persons located on a plane. The i-th person is located at the point (x_i, y_i) and initially looks at the point (u_i, v_i).At the same moment of time, all persons will start to rotate clockwise synchronously with the same angular speed. They will rotate until they do one full 360-degree turn. It is said that persons A and B made eye contact if person A looks in person B's direction at the same moment when person B looks in person A's direction. If there is a person C located between persons A and B, that will not obstruct A and B from making eye contact. A person can make eye contact with more than one person at the same time.Calculate the number of pairs of persons that will make eye contact at least once during the rotation (including the initial moment).
