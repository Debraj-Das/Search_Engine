Berland scientists know that the Old Berland language had exactly n words Those words had lengths of l1l2ln letters Every word consisted of two letters 0 and 1 Ancient Berland people spoke quickly and didnt make pauses between the words but at the same time they could always understand each other perfectly It was possible because no word was a prefix of another one The prefix of a string is considered to be one of its substrings that starts from the initial symbolHelp the scientists determine whether all the words of the Old Berland language can be reconstructed and if they can output the words themselves
