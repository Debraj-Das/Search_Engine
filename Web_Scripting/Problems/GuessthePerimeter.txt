Let us call a point of the plane admissible if its coordinates are positive integers less than or equal to 200.There is an invisible rectangle such that:   its vertices are all admissible;  its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes;  its area is strictly positive.  Your task is to guess the perimeter of this rectangle.In order to guess it, you may ask at most 4 queries. In each query, you choose a nonempty subset of the admissible points and you are told how many of the chosen points are inside or on the boundary of the invisible rectangle.
