...Once upon a time a man came to the sea. The sea was stormy and dark. The man started to call for the little mermaid to appear but alas, he only woke up Cthulhu...Whereas on the other end of the world Pentagon is actively collecting information trying to predict the monster's behavior and preparing the secret super weapon. Due to high seismic activity and poor weather conditions the satellites haven't yet been able to make clear shots of the monster. The analysis of the first shot resulted in an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. Now the world's best minds are about to determine whether this graph can be regarded as Cthulhu or not.To add simplicity, let's suppose that Cthulhu looks from the space like some spherical body with tentacles attached to it. Formally, we shall regard as Cthulhu such an undirected graph that can be represented as a set of three or more rooted trees, whose roots are connected by a simple cycle.It is guaranteed that the graph contains no multiple edges and self-loops.
