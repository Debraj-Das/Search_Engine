The Human-Cow Confederation (HC2), led by Heidi, has built a base where people and cows can hide, guarded from zombie attacks. The entrance to the base is protected by an automated gate which performs a kind of a Turing test: it shows the entering creature a photograph and asks them whether the top and bottom halves of this photograph have been swapped or not. A person (or even a cow) will have no problem answering such questions; on the other hand, a zombie would just randomly smash one of the two buttons.The creature is asked a series of such questions. If at least 75% of them are answered correctly, the gate is unlocked; otherwise, a side door opens, beneath which a huge fan is spinning...Heidi is now building a robot army to fight the zombies, and she wants the robots to also be able to enter the base. You are tasked with programming them to distinguish the images. The first two images from the test set. The first picture has been rearranged, but not the second.
