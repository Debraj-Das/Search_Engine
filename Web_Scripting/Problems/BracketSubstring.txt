You are given a bracket sequence s (not necessarily a regular one). A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters '(' and ')'.A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(", "(" and ")" are not.Your problem is to calculate the number of regular bracket sequences of length 2n containing the given bracket sequence s as a substring (consecutive sequence of characters) modulo 10^9+7 (1000000007).
