You are given two lists of segments [al_1, ar_1], [al_2, ar_2], \dots, [al_n, ar_n] and [bl_1, br_1], [bl_2, br_2], \dots, [bl_n, br_n].Initially, all segments [al_i, ar_i] are equal to [l_1, r_1] and all segments [bl_i, br_i] are equal to [l_2, r_2].In one step, you can choose one segment (either from the first or from the second list) and extend it by 1. In other words, suppose you've chosen segment [x, y] then you can transform it either into [x - 1, y] or into [x, y + 1].Let's define a total intersection I as the sum of lengths of intersections of the corresponding pairs of segments, i.e. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{\text{intersection_length}([al_i, ar_i], [bl_i, br_i])}. Empty intersection has length 0 and length of a segment [x, y] is equal to y - x.What is the minimum number of steps you need to make I greater or equal to k?
