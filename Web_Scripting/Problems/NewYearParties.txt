Oh, New Year. The time to gather all your friends and reflect on the heartwarming events of the past year...n friends live in a city which can be represented as a number line. The i-th friend lives in a house with an integer coordinate x_i. The i-th friend can come celebrate the New Year to the house with coordinate x_i-1, x_i+1 or stay at x_i. Each friend is allowed to move no more than once.For all friends 1 \le x_i \le n holds, however, they can come to houses with coordinates 0 and n+1 (if their houses are at 1 or n, respectively).For example, let the initial positions be x = [1, 2, 4, 4]. The final ones then can be [1, 3, 3, 4], [0, 2, 3, 3], [2, 2, 5, 5], [2, 1, 3, 5] and so on. The number of occupied houses is the number of distinct positions among the final ones.So all friends choose the moves they want to perform. After that the number of occupied houses is calculated. What is the minimum and the maximum number of occupied houses can there be?
