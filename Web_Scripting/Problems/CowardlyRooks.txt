There's a chessboard of size n \times n. m rooks are placed on it in such a way that:   no two rooks occupy the same cell;  no two rooks attack each other. A rook attacks all cells that are in its row or column.Is it possible to move exactly one rook (you can choose which one to move) into a different cell so that no two rooks still attack each other? A rook can move into any cell in its row or column if no other rook stands on its path.
