It is known that there are k fish species in the polar ocean numbered from 1 to k They are sorted by nondecreasing order of their weight which is a positive number Let the weight of the ith type of fish be wi then 0w1w2wk holdsPolar bears Alice and Bob each have caught some fish and they are guessing who has the larger sum of weight of the fish heshes caught Given the type of the fish theyve caught determine whether it is possible that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight than Bobs In other words does there exist a sequence of weights wi not necessary integers such that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight
