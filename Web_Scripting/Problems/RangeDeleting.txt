You are given an array consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n and an integer x. It is guaranteed that for every i, 1 \le a_i \le x.Let's denote a function f(l, r) which erases all values such that l \le a_i \le r from the array a and returns the resulting array. For example, if a = [4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2, 4, 3], then f(2, 4) = [1, 1, 5].Your task is to calculate the number of pairs (l, r) such that 1 \le l \le r \le x and f(l, r) is sorted in non-descending order. Note that the empty array is also considered sorted.
