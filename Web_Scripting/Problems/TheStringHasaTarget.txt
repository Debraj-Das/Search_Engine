You are given a string s. You can apply this operation to the string exactly once: choose index i and move character s_i to the beginning of the string (removing it at the old position). For example, if you apply the operation with index i=4 to the string "abaacd" with numbering from 1, you get the string "aabacd". What is the lexicographically minimal^{\dagger} string you can obtain by this operation?^{\dagger}A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b of the same length if and only if the following holds:   in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
