Today Hayato came home from school with homework.In the assignment, Hayato was given an array a of length n. The task was to find 3 numbers in this array whose sum is odd. At school, he claimed that there are such 3 numbers, but Hayato was not sure, so he asked you for help.Answer if there are such three numbers, and if so, output indices i, j, and k such that a_i + a_j + a_k is odd.The odd numbers are integers that are not divisible by 2: 1, 3, 5, and so on.
