Good old Berland has n cities and m roads Each road connects a pair of distinct cities and is bidirectional Between any pair of cities there is at most one road For each road we know its lengthWe also know that the President will soon ride along the Berland roads from city s to city t Naturally he will choose one of the shortest paths from s to t but nobody can say for sure which path he will chooseThe Minister for Transport is really afraid that the President might get upset by the state of the roads in the country That is the reason he is planning to repair the roads in the possible Presidents pathMaking the budget for such an event is not an easy task For all possible distinct pairs st st find the number of roads that lie on at least one shortest path from s to t
