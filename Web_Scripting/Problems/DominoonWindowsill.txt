You have a board represented as a grid with 2 \times n cells.The first k_1 cells on the first row and first k_2 cells on the second row are colored in white. All other cells are colored in black.You have w white dominoes (2 \times 1 tiles, both cells are colored in white) and b black dominoes (2 \times 1 tiles, both cells are colored in black).You can place a white domino on the board if both board's cells are white and not occupied by any other domino. In the same way, you can place a black domino if both cells are black and not occupied by any other domino.Can you place all w + b dominoes on the board if you can place dominoes both horizontally and vertically?
