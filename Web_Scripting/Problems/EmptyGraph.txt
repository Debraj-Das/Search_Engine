 — Do you have a wish?  — I want people to stop gifting each other arrays.O_o and Another Young BoyAn array of n positive integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n fell down on you from the skies, along with a positive integer k \le n.You can apply the following operation at most k times:   Choose an index 1 \le i \le n and an integer 1 \le x \le 10^9. Then do a_i := x (assign x to a_i). Then build a complete undirected weighted graph with n vertices numbered with integers from 1 to n, where edge (l, r) (1 \le l < r \le n) has weight \min(a_{l},a_{l+1},\ldots,a_{r}).You have to find the maximum possible diameter of the resulting graph after performing at most k operations.The diameter of a graph is equal to \max\limits_{1 \le u < v \le n}{\operatorname{d}(u, v)}, where \operatorname{d}(u, v) is the length of the shortest path between vertex u and vertex v.
