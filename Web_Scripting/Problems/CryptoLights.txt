  To monitor cryptocurrency exchange rates trader William invented a wonderful device consisting of n lights arranged in a row. The device functions in the following way:Initially, all lights on William's device are turned off. At the beginning of a new iteration the device randomly, with a uniform distribution, picks a light that is turned off and turns it on, telling William which cryptocurrency he should invest in. After this iteration if any k consecutive lights contain more than one turned on light, then the device finishes working.William doesn't like uncertainty, so he wants you to calculate the expected value of the number of lights that are turned on in the device after it finishes working.
