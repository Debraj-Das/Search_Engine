You are given a permutation a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n of the first n positive integers. A subarray [l,r] is called copium if we can rearrange it so that it becomes a sequence of consecutive integers, or more formally, if \max(a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r)-\min(a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r)=r-l For each k in the range [0,n], print out the maximum number of copium subarrays of a over all ways of rearranging the last n-k elements of a.
