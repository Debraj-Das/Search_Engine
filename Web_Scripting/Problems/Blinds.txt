The blinds are known to consist of opaque horizontal stripes that can be rotated thus regulating the amount of light flowing in the room There are n blind stripes with the width of 1 in the factory warehouse for blind production The problem is that all of them are spare details from different orders that is they may not have the same length it is even possible for them to have different lengthsEvery stripe can be cut into two or more parts The cuttings are made perpendicularly to the side along which the length is measured Thus the cuttings do not change the width of a stripe but each of the resulting pieces has a lesser length the sum of which is equal to the length of the initial stripeAfter all the cuttings the blinds are constructed through consecutive joining of several parts similar in length along sides along which length is measured Also apart from the resulting pieces an initial stripe can be used as a blind if it hasnt been cut It is forbidden to construct blinds in any other wayThus if the blinds consist of k pieces each d in length then they are of form of a rectangle of kd bourlemeters Your task is to find for what window possessing the largest possible area the blinds can be made from the given stripes if on technical grounds it is forbidden to use pieces shorter than l bourlemeter The window is of form of a rectangle with side lengths as positive integers
