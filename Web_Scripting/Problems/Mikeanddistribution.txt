Mike has always been thinking about the harshness of social inequality Hes so obsessed with it that sometimes it even affects him while solving problems At the moment Mike has two sequences of positive integers Aa1a2an and Bb1b2bn of length n each which he uses to ask people some quite peculiar questionsTo test you on how good are you at spotting inequality in life he wants you to find an unfair subset of the original sequence To be more precise he wants you to select k numbers Pp1p2pk such that 1pin for 1ik and elements in P are distinct Sequence P will represent indices of elements that youll select from both sequences He calls such a subset P unfair if and only if the following conditions are satisfied 2ap1apk is greater than the sum of all elements from sequence A and 2bp1bpk is greater than the sum of all elements from the sequence B Also k should be smaller or equal to  because it will be to easy to find sequence P if he allowed you to select too many elementsMike guarantees you that a solution will always exist given the conditions described above so please help him satisfy his curiosity
