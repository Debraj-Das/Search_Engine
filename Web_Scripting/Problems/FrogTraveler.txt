Frog Gorf is traveling through Swamp kingdom. Unfortunately, after a poor jump, he fell into a well of n meters depth. Now Gorf is on the bottom of the well and has a long way up.The surface of the well's walls vary in quality: somewhere they are slippery, but somewhere have convenient ledges. In other words, if Gorf is on x meters below ground level, then in one jump he can go up on any integer distance from 0 to a_x meters inclusive. (Note that Gorf can't jump down, only up).Unfortunately, Gorf has to take a break after each jump (including jump on 0 meters). And after jumping up to position x meters below ground level, he'll slip exactly b_x meters down while resting.Calculate the minimum number of jumps Gorf needs to reach ground level.
