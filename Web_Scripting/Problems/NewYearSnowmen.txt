As meticulous Gerald sets the table and caring Alexander sends the postcards, Sergey makes snowmen. Each showman should consist of three snowballs: a big one, a medium one and a small one. Sergey's twins help him: they've already made n snowballs with radii equal to r1, r2, ..., rn. To make a snowman, one needs any three snowballs whose radii are pairwise different. For example, the balls with radii 1, 2 and 3 can be used to make a snowman but 2, 2, 3 or 2, 2, 2 cannot. Help Sergey and his twins to determine what maximum number of snowmen they can make from those snowballs.
