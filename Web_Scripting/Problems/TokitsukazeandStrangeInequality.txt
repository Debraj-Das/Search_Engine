Tokitsukaze has a permutation p of length n. Recall that a permutation p of length n is a sequence p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n consisting of n distinct integers, each of which from 1 to n (1 \leq p_i \leq n).She wants to know how many different indices tuples [a,b,c,d] (1 \leq a < b < c < d \leq n) in this permutation satisfy the following two inequalities:  p_a < p_c and p_b > p_d. Note that two tuples [a_1,b_1,c_1,d_1] and [a_2,b_2,c_2,d_2] are considered to be different if a_1 \ne a_2 or b_1 \ne b_2 or c_1 \ne c_2 or d_1 \ne d_2.
