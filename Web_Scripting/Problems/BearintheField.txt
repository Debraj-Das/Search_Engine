Our bears forest has a checkered field The checkered field is an nn table the rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom the columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right Lets denote a cell of the field on the intersection of row x and column y by record xy Each cell of the field contains growing raspberry at that the cell xy of the field contains xy raspberry bushesThe bear came out to walk across the field At the beginning of the walk his speed is dxdy Then the bear spends exactly t seconds on the field Each second the following takes place  Lets suppose that at the current moment the bear is in cell xy  First the bear eats the raspberry from all the bushes he has in the current cell After the bear eats the raspberry from k bushes he increases each component of his speed by k In other words if before eating the k bushes of raspberry his speed was dxdy then after eating the berry his speed equals dxkdyk  Lets denote the current speed of the bear dxdy it was increased after the previous step Then the bear moves from cell xy to cell xdx1modn1ydy1modn1  Then one additional raspberry bush grows in each cell of the field You task is to predict the bears actions Find the cell he ends up in if he starts from cell sxsy Assume that each bush has infinitely much raspberry and the bear will never eat all of it
