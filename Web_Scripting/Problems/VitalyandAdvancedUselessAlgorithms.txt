Vitaly enrolled in the course Advanced Useless Algorithms. The course consists of n tasks. Vitaly calculated that he has a_i hours to do the task i from the day he enrolled in the course. That is, the deadline before the i-th task is a_i hours. The array a is sorted in ascending order, in other words, the job numbers correspond to the order in which the assignments are turned in.Vitaly does everything conscientiously, so he wants to complete each task by 100 percent, or more. Initially, his completion rate for each task is 0 percent.Vitaly has m training options, each option can be used not more than once. The ith option is characterized by three integers: e_i, t_i and p_i. If Vitaly uses the ith option, then after t_i hours (from the current moment) he will increase the progress of the task e_i by p_i percent. For example, let Vitaly have 3 of tasks to complete. Let the array a have the form: a = [5, 7, 8]. Suppose Vitaly has 5 of options: [e_1=1, t_1=1, p_1=30], [e_2=2, t_2=3, p_2=50], [e_3=2, t_3=3, p_3=100], [e_4=1, t_4=1, p_4=80], [e_5=3, t_5=3, p_5=100]. Then, if Vitaly prepares in the following way, he will be able to complete everything in time:   Vitaly chooses the 4-th option. Then in 1 hour, he will complete the 1-st task at 80 percent. He still has 4 hours left before the deadline for the 1-st task.  Vitaly chooses the 3-rd option. Then in 3 hours, he will complete the 2-nd task in its entirety. He has another 1 hour left before the deadline for the 1-st task and 4 hours left before the deadline for the 3-rd task.  Vitaly chooses the 1-st option. Then after 1 hour, he will complete the 1-st task for 110 percent, which means that he will complete the 1-st task just in time for the deadline.  Vitaly chooses the 5-th option. He will complete the 3-rd task for 2 hours, and after another 1 hour, Vitaly will complete the 3-rd task in its entirety. Thus, Vitaly has managed to complete the course completely and on time, using the 4 options.Help Vitaly — print the options for Vitaly to complete the tasks in the correct order. Please note: each option can be used not more than once. If there are several possible answers, it is allowed to output any of them.
