A palindrome is a string t which reads the same backward as forward (formally, t[i] = t[|t| + 1 - i] for all i \in [1, |t|]). Here |t| denotes the length of a string t. For example, the strings 010, 1001 and 0 are palindromes.You have n binary strings s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n (each s_i consists of zeroes and/or ones). You can swap any pair of characters any number of times (possibly, zero). Characters can be either from the same string or from different strings — there are no restrictions.Formally, in one move you:  choose four integer numbers x, a, y, b such that 1 \le x, y \le n and 1 \le a \le |s_x| and 1 \le b \le |s_y| (where x and y are string indices and a and b are positions in strings s_x and s_y respectively),  swap (exchange) the characters s_x[a] and s_y[b]. What is the maximum number of strings you can make palindromic simultaneously?
