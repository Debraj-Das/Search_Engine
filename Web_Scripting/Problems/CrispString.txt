You are given a string of length n. Each character is one of the first p lowercase Latin letters.You are also given a matrix A with binary values of size p \times p. This matrix is symmetric (A_{ij} = A_{ji}). A_{ij} = 1 means that the string can have the i-th and j-th letters of Latin alphabet adjacent.Let's call the string crisp if all of the adjacent characters in it can be adjacent (have 1 in the corresponding cell of matrix A).You are allowed to do the following move. Choose any letter, remove all its occurrences and join the remaining parts of the string without changing their order. For example, removing letter 'a' from "abacaba" will yield "bcb".The string you are given is crisp. The string should remain crisp after every move you make.You are allowed to do arbitrary number of moves (possible zero). What is the shortest resulting string you can obtain?
