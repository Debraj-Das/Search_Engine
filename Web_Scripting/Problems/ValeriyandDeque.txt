Recently, on the course of algorithms and data structures, Valeriy learned how to use a deque. He built a deque filled with n elements. The i-th element is a_i (i = 1, 2, \ldots, n). He gradually takes the first two leftmost elements from the deque (let's call them A and B, respectively), and then does the following: if A > B, he writes A to the beginning and writes B to the end of the deque, otherwise, he writes to the beginning B, and A writes to the end of the deque. We call this sequence of actions an operation.For example, if deque was [2, 3, 4, 5, 1], on the operation he will write B=3 to the beginning and A=2 to the end, so he will get [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].The teacher of the course, seeing Valeriy, who was passionate about his work, approached him and gave him q queries. Each query consists of the singular number m_j (j = 1, 2, \ldots, q). It is required for each query to answer which two elements he will pull out on the m_j-th operation.Note that the queries are independent and for each query the numbers A and B should be printed in the order in which they will be pulled out of the deque.Deque is a data structure representing a list of elements where insertion of new elements or deletion of existing elements can be made from both sides.
