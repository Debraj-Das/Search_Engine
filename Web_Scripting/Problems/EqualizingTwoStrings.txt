You are given two strings s and t both of length n and both consisting of lowercase Latin letters.In one move, you can choose any length len from 1 to n and perform the following operation:   Choose any contiguous substring of the string s of length len and reverse it;  at the same time choose any contiguous substring of the string t of length len and reverse it as well. Note that during one move you reverse exactly one substring of the string s and exactly one substring of the string t.Also note that borders of substrings you reverse in s and in t can be different, the only restriction is that you reverse the substrings of equal length. For example, if len=3 and n=5, you can reverse s[1 \dots 3] and t[3 \dots 5], s[2 \dots 4] and t[2 \dots 4], but not s[1 \dots 3] and t[1 \dots 2].Your task is to say if it is possible to make strings s and t equal after some (possibly, empty) sequence of moves.You have to answer q independent test cases.
