Alice and Bob are playing a game with n piles of stones. It is guaranteed that n is an even number. The i-th pile has a_i stones.Alice and Bob will play a game alternating turns with Alice going first.On a player's turn, they must choose exactly \frac{n}{2} nonempty piles and independently remove a positive number of stones from each of the chosen piles. They can remove a different number of stones from the piles in a single turn. The first player unable to make a move loses (when there are less than \frac{n}{2} nonempty piles).Given the starting configuration, determine who will win the game.
