Bike is interested in permutations A permutation of length n is an integer sequence such that each integer from 0 to n1 appears exactly once in it For example 021 is a permutation of length 3 while both 022 and 123 is notA permutation triple of permutations of length n abc is called a Lucky Permutation Triple if and only if  The sign ai denotes the ith element of permutation a The modular equality described above denotes that the remainders after dividing aibi by n and dividing ci by n are equalNow he has an integer n and wants to find a Lucky Permutation Triple Could you please help him
