This is an interactive problem.Ayush devised yet another scheme to set the password of his lock. The lock has n slots where each slot can hold any non-negative integer. The password P is a sequence of n integers, i-th element of which goes into the i-th slot of the lock.To set the password, Ayush comes up with an array A of n integers each in the range [0, 2^{63}-1]. He then sets the i-th element of P as the bitwise OR of all integers in the array except A_i.You need to guess the password. To make a query, you can choose a non-empty subset of indices of the array and ask the bitwise OR all elements of the array with index in this subset. You can ask no more than 13 queries.
