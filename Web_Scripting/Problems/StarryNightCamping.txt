At the foot of Liyushan Mountain, n tents will be carefully arranged to provide accommodation for those who are willing to experience the joy of approaching nature, the tranquility of the night, and the bright starry sky.The i-th tent is located at the point of (x_i, y_i) and has a weight of w_i. A tent is important if and only if both x_i and y_i are even. You need to remove some tents such that for each remaining important tent (x, y), there do not exist 3 other tents (x'_1, y'_1), (x'_2, y'_2) and (x'_3, y'_3) such that both conditions are true:   |x'_j-x|, |y'_j - y|\leq 1 for all j \in \{1, 2, 3\}, and  these four tents form a parallelogram (or a rectangle) and one of its sides is parallel to the x-axis. Please maximize the sum of the weights of the tents that are not removed. Print the maximum value.
