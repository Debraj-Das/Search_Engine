You are given a huge decimal number consisting of n digits. It is guaranteed that this number has no leading zeros. Each digit of this number is either 0 or 1.You may perform several (possibly zero) operations with this number. During each operation you are allowed to change any digit of your number; you may change 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. It is possible that after some operation you can obtain a number with leading zeroes, but it does not matter for this problem.You are also given two integers 0 \le y < x < n. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations you should perform to obtain the number that has remainder 10^y modulo 10^x. In other words, the obtained number should have remainder 10^y when divided by 10^x.
