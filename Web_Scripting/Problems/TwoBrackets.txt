You are given a string s, consisting of brackets of two types: '(', ')', '[' and ']'.A string is called a regular bracket sequence (RBS) if it's of one of the following types:   empty string;  '(' + RBS + ')';  '[' + RBS + ']';  RBS + RBS. where plus is a concatenation of two strings.In one move you can choose a non-empty subsequence of the string s (not necessarily consecutive) that is an RBS, remove it from the string and concatenate the remaining parts without changing the order.What is the maximum number of moves you can perform?
