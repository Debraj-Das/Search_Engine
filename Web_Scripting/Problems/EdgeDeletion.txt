You are given an undirected connected weighted graph consisting of n vertices and m edges. Let's denote the length of the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex i as d_i. You have to erase some edges of the graph so that at most k edges remain. Let's call a vertex i good if there still exists a path from 1 to i with length d_i after erasing the edges.Your goal is to erase the edges in such a way that the number of good vertices is maximized.
