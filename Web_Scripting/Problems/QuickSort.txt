You are given a permutation^\dagger p of length n and a positive integer k \le n.In one operation, you:   Choose k distinct elements p_{i_1}, p_{i_2}, \ldots, p_{i_k}.  Remove them and then add them sorted in increasing order to the end of the permutation. For example, if p = [2,5,1,3,4] and k = 2 and you choose 5 and 3 as the elements for the operation, then [2, \color{red}{5}, 1, \color{red}{3}, 4] \rightarrow [2, 1, 4, \color{red}{3},\color{red}{5}].Find the minimum number of operations needed to sort the permutation in increasing order. It can be proven that it is always possible to do so.^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
