A binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1.Let \operatorname{MEX} of a binary string be the smallest digit among 0, 1, or 2 that does not occur in the string. For example, \operatorname{MEX} of 001011 is 2, because 0 and 1 occur in the string at least once, \operatorname{MEX} of 1111 is 0, because 0 and 2 do not occur in the string and 0 < 2.A binary string s is given. You should cut it into any number of substrings such that each character is in exactly one substring. It is possible to cut the string into a single substring — the whole string.A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.What is the minimal sum of \operatorname{MEX} of all substrings pieces can be?
