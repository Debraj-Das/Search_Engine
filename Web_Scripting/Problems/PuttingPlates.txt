To celebrate your birthday you have prepared a festive table! Now you want to seat as many guests as possible.The table can be represented as a rectangle with height h and width w, divided into h \times w cells. Let (i, j) denote the cell in the i-th row and the j-th column of the rectangle (1 \le i \le h; 1 \le j \le w).Into each cell of the table you can either put a plate or keep it empty.As each guest has to be seated next to their plate, you can only put plates on the edge of the table — into the first or the last row of the rectangle, or into the first or the last column. Formally, for each cell (i, j) you put a plate into, at least one of the following conditions must be satisfied: i = 1, i = h, j = 1, j = w.To make the guests comfortable, no two plates must be put into cells that have a common side or corner. In other words, if cell (i, j) contains a plate, you can't put plates into cells (i - 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i + 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i - 1, j - 1), (i - 1, j + 1), (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j + 1).Put as many plates on the table as possible without violating the rules above.
