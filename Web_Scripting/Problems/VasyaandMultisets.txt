Vasya has a multiset s consisting of n integer numbers. Vasya calls some number x nice if it appears in the multiset exactly once. For example, multiset \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4\} contains nice numbers 2 and 4.Vasya wants to split multiset s into two multisets a and b (one of which may be empty) in such a way that the quantity of nice numbers in multiset a would be the same as the quantity of nice numbers in multiset b (the quantity of numbers to appear exactly once in multiset a and the quantity of numbers to appear exactly once in multiset b).
