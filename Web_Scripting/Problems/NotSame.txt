You are given an integer array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, where a_i represents the number of blocks at the i-th position. It is guaranteed that 1 \le a_i \le n. In one operation you can choose a subset of indices of the given array and remove one block in each of these indices. You can't remove a block from a position without blocks.All subsets that you choose should be different (unique).You need to remove all blocks in the array using at most n+1 operations. It can be proved that the answer always exists.
