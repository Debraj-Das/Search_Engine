There are five people playing a game called "Generosity". Each person gives some non-zero number of coins b as an initial bet. After all players make their bets of b coins, the following operation is repeated for several times: a coin is passed from one player to some other player.Your task is to write a program that can, given the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, determine the size b of the initial bet or find out that such outcome of the game cannot be obtained for any positive number of coins b in the initial bet.
