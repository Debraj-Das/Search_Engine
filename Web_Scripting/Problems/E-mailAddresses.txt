One of the most important products of the R1 company is a popular r1com mail service The R1 mailboxes receive and send millions of emails every dayToday the online news thundered with terrible information The R1 database crashed and almost no data could be saved except for one big string The developers assume that the string contains the letters of some users of the R1 mail Recovering letters is a tedious mostly manual work So before you start this process it was decided to estimate the difficulty of recovering Namely we need to calculate the number of different substrings of the saved string that form correct email addressesWe assume that valid addresses are only the email addresses which meet the following criteria  the address should begin with a nonempty sequence of letters numbers characters  starting with a letter  then must go character   then must go a nonempty sequence of letters or numbers  then must go character   the address must end with a nonempty sequence of letters You got lucky again and the job was entrusted to you Please note that the substring is several consecutive characters in a string Two substrings one consisting of the characters of the string with numbers l1l11l12r1 and the other one consisting of the characters of the string with numbers l2l21l22r2 are considered distinct if l1l2 or r1r2
