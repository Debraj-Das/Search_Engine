What walks on four feet in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three at night?This is an interactive problem. This problem doesn't support hacks.Sphinx's duty is to guard the city of Thebes by making sure that no unworthy traveler crosses its gates. Only the ones who answer her riddle timely and correctly (or get an acc for short) are allowed to pass. As of those who fail, no one heard of them ever again...So you don't have a choice but to solve the riddle. Sphinx has an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of nonnegative integers strictly smaller than 2^b and asked you to find the maximum value among its elements. Of course, she will not show you the array, but she will give you n and b. As it is impossible to answer this riddle blindly, you can ask her some questions. For given i, y, she'll answer you whether a_i is bigger than y. As sphinxes are not very patient, you can ask at most 3 \cdot (n + b)  such questions.Although cunning, sphinxes are honest. Even though the array can change between your queries, answers to the previously asked questions will remain valid.
