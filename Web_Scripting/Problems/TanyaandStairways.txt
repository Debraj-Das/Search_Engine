Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from 1 to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains 3 steps, and the second contains 4 steps, she will pronounce the numbers 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4.You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.
