There are n bags, each bag contains m balls with numbers from 1 to m. For every i \in [1, m], there is exactly one ball with number i in each bag.You have to take exactly one ball from each bag (all bags are different, so, for example, taking the ball 1 from the first bag and the ball 2 from the second bag is not the same as taking the ball 2 from the first bag and the ball 1 from the second bag). After that, you calculate the number of balls with odd numbers among the ones you have taken. Let the number of these balls be F.Your task is to calculate the sum of F^k over all possible ways to take n balls, one from each bag.
