A class of students got bored wearing the same pair of shoes every day, so they decided to shuffle their shoes among themselves. In this problem, a pair of shoes is inseparable and is considered as a single object.There are n students in the class, and you are given an array s in non-decreasing order, where s_i is the shoe size of the i-th student. A shuffling of shoes is valid only if no student gets their own shoes and if every student gets shoes of size greater than or equal to their size. You have to output a permutation p of \{1,2,\ldots,n\} denoting a valid shuffling of shoes, where the i-th student gets the shoes of the p_i-th student (p_i \ne i). And output -1 if a valid shuffling does not exist.A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
