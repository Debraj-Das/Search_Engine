Given an integer n.Consider all pairs of integer arrays a and p of the same length such that n = \prod a_i^{p_i} (i.e. a_1^{p_1}\cdot a_2^{p_2}\cdot\ldots) (a_i>1;p_i>0) and a_i is the product of some (possibly one) distinct prime numbers.For example, for n = 28 = 2^2\cdot 7^1 = 4^1 \cdot 7^1 the array pair a = [2, 7], p = [2, 1] is correct, but the pair of arrays a = [4, 7], p = [1, 1] is not, because 4=2^2 is a product of non-distinct prime numbers.Your task is to find the maximum value of \sum a_i \cdot p_i (i.e. a_1\cdot p_1 + a_2\cdot p_2 + \ldots) over all possible pairs of arrays a and p. Note that you do not need to minimize or maximize the length of the arrays.
