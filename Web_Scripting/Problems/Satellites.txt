Real Cosmic Communications is the largest telecommunication company on a far far away planet located at the very edge of the universe RCC launches communication satellitesThe planet is at the very edge of the universe so its form is half of a circle Its radius is r the ends of its diameter are points A and B The line AB is the edge of the universe so one of the halfplanes contains nothing neither the planet nor RCC satellites nor anything else Let us introduce coordinates in the following way the origin is at the center of AB segment OX axis coincides with line AB the planet is completely in y0 halfplaneThe satellite can be in any point of the universe except the planet points Satellites are never located beyond the edge of the universe nor on the edge itself  that is they have coordinate y0 Satellite antennas are directed in such way that they cover the angle with the vertex in the satellite and edges directed to points A and B Let us call this area the satellite coverage area The picture below shows coordinate system and coverage area of a satellite  When RCC was founded there were no satellites around the planet Since then there have been several events of one of the following types   1 x y launch the new satellite and put it to the point xy Satellites never move and stay at the point they were launched Let us assign the number i to the ith satellite in order of launching starting from one  2 i remove satellite number i  3 i j make an attempt to create a communication channel between satellites i and j To create a communication channel a repeater is required It must not be located inside the planet but can be located at its halfcircle border or above it Repeater must be in coverage area of both satellites i and j To avoid signal interference it must not be located in coverage area of any other satellite Of course the repeater must be within the universe it must have a coordinate y0 For each attempt to create a communication channel you must find out whether it is possibleSample test has the following satellites locations
