A school has to decide on its team for an international quiz. There are n students in the school. We can describe the students using an array a where a_i is the smartness of the i-th (1 \le i \le n) student. There are m topics 1, 2, 3, \ldots, m from which the quiz questions will be formed. The i-th student is considered proficient in a topic T if (a_i \bmod T) = 0. Otherwise, he is a rookie in that topic. We say that a team of students is collectively proficient in all the topics if for every topic there is a member of the team proficient in this topic.Find a team that is collectively proficient in all the topics such that the maximum difference between the smartness of any two students in that team is minimized. Output this difference.
