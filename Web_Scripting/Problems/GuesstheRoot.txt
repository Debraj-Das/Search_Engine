Jury picked a polynomial f(x) = a_0 + a_1 \cdot x + a_2 \cdot x^2 + \dots + a_k \cdot x^k. k \le 10 and all a_i are integer numbers and 0 \le a_i < 10^6 + 3. It's guaranteed that there is at least one i such that a_i > 0.Now jury wants you to find such an integer x_0 that f(x_0) \equiv 0 \mod (10^6 + 3) or report that there is not such x_0.You can ask no more than 50 queries: you ask value x_q and jury tells you value f(x_q) \mod (10^6 + 3).Note that printing the answer doesn't count as a query.
