Polycarp is working on a new operating system called BerOS. He asks you to help with implementation of a file suggestion feature.There are n files on hard drive and their names are f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n. Any file name contains between 1 and 8 characters, inclusive. All file names are unique.The file suggestion feature handles queries, each represented by a string s. For each query s it should count number of files containing s as a substring (i.e. some continuous segment of characters in a file name equals s) and suggest any such file name.For example, if file names are "read.me", "hosts", "ops", and "beros.18", and the query is "os", the number of matched files is 2 (two file names contain "os" as a substring) and suggested file name can be either "hosts" or "beros.18".
