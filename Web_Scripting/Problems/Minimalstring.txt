Petya recieved a gift of a string s with length up to 105 characters for his birthday. He took two more empty strings t and u and decided to play a game. This game has two possible moves:  Extract the first character of s and append t with this character.  Extract the last character of t and append u with this character. Petya wants to get strings s and t empty and string u lexicographically minimal.You should write a program that will help Petya win the game.
