You are given N points on an infinite plane with the Cartesian coordinate system on it. N-1 points lay on one line, and one point isn't on that line. You are on point K at the start, and the goal is to visit every point. You can move between any two points in a straight line, and you can revisit points. What is the minimum length of the path?
