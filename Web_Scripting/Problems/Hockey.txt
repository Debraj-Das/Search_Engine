Petya loves hockey very much One day as he was watching a hockey match he fell asleep Petya dreamt of being appointed to change a hockey teams name Thus Petya was given the original team name w and the collection of forbidden substrings s1s2sn All those strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters String w has the length of w its characters are numbered from 1 to wFirst Petya should find all the occurrences of forbidden substrings in the w string During the search of substrings the case of letter shouldnt be taken into consideration That is strings aBC and ABc are considered equalAfter that Petya should perform the replacement of all letters covered by the occurrences More formally a letter in the position i should be replaced by any other one if for position i in string w there exist pair of indices lr 1lirw such that substring wlr is contained in the collection s1s2sn when using case insensitive comparison During the replacement the letters case should remain the same Petya is not allowed to replace the letters that arent covered by any forbidden substringLetter letter uppercase or lowercase is considered lucky for the hockey players Thats why Petya should perform the changes so that the letter occurred in the resulting string as many times as possible Help Petya to find such resulting string If there are several such strings find the one that comes first lexicographicallyNote that the process of replacements is not repeated it occurs only once That is if after Petyas replacements the string started to contain new occurrences of bad substrings Petya pays no attention to them
