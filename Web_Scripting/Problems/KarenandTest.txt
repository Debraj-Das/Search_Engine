Karen has just arrived at school and she has a math test today  The test is about basic addition and subtraction Unfortunately the teachers were too busy writing tasks for Codeforces rounds and had no time to make an actual test So they just put one question in the test that is worth all the pointsThere are n integers written on a row Karen must alternately add and subtract each pair of adjacent integers and write down the sums or differences on the next row She must repeat this process on the values on the next row and so on until only one integer remains The first operation should be additionNote that if she ended the previous row by adding the integers she should start the next row by subtracting and vice versaThe teachers will simply look at the last integer and then if it is correct Karen gets a perfect score otherwise she gets a zero for the testKaren has studied well for this test but she is scared that she might make a mistake somewhere and it will cause her final answer to be wrong If the process is followed what number can she expect to be written on the last rowSince this number can be quite large output only the nonnegative remainder after dividing it by 1097
