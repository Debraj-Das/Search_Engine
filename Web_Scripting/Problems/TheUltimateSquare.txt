You have n rectangular wooden blocks, which are numbered from 1 to n. The i-th block is 1 unit high and \lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil units long.Here, \lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil denotes the result of division of x by 2, rounded up. For example, \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 and \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = \lceil 2.5 \rceil = 3.For example, if n=5, then the blocks have the following sizes: 1 \times 1, 1 \times 1, 1 \times 2, 1 \times 2, 1 \times 3.  The available blocks for n=5 Find the maximum possible side length of a square you can create using these blocks, without rotating any of them. Note that you don't have to use all of the blocks.  One of the ways to create 3 \times 3 square using blocks 1 through 5
