The only difference between the easy and the hard version is the limit to the number of queries.This is an interactive problem.There is an array a of n different numbers. In one query you can ask the position of the second maximum element in a subsegment a[l..r]. Find the position of the maximum element in the array in no more than 40 queries.A subsegment a[l..r] is all the elements a_l, a_{l + 1}, ..., a_r. After asking this subsegment you will be given the position of the second maximum from this subsegment in the whole array.
