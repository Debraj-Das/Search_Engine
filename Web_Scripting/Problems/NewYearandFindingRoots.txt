This is an interactive problem In the interaction section below you will find the information about flushing the outputThe New Year tree of height h is a perfect binary tree with vertices numbered 1 through 2h1 in some order In this problem we assume that h is at least 2 The drawing below shows one example New Year tree of height 3  Polar bears love decorating the New Year tree and Limak is no exception To decorate the tree he must first find its root ie a vertex with exactly two neighbours assuming that h2 It wont be easy because Limak is a little bear and he doesnt even see the whole tree Can you help himThere are t testcases In each testcase you should first read h from the input Then you can ask at most 16 questions of format  x without quotes where x is an integer between 1 and 2h1 inclusive As a reply you will get the list of neighbours of vertex x more details in the Interaction section below For example for a tree on the drawing above after asking  1 you would get a response with 3 neighbours 4 5 and 7 Your goal is to find the index of the root y and print it in the format  y You will be able to read h for a next testcase only after printing the answer in a previous testcase and flushing the outputEach tree is fixed from the beginning and it doesnt change during your questions
