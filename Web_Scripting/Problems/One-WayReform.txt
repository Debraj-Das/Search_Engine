There are n cities and m two-way roads in Berland, each road connects two cities. It is known that there is no more than one road connecting each pair of cities, and there is no road which connects the city with itself. It is possible that there is no way to get from one city to some other city using only these roads.The road minister decided to make a reform in Berland and to orient all roads in the country, i.e. to make each road one-way. The minister wants to maximize the number of cities, for which the number of roads that begins in the city equals to the number of roads that ends in it.
