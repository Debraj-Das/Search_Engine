Recently Dima met with Sasha in a philatelic store and since then they are collecting coins together Their favorite occupation is to sort collections of coins Sasha likes having things in order that is why he wants his coins to be arranged in a row in such a way that firstly come coins out of circulation and then come coins still in circulation For arranging coins Dima uses the following algorithm One step of his algorithm looks like the following  He looks through all the coins from left to right  If he sees that the ith coin is still in circulation and i1th coin is already out of circulation he exchanges these two coins and continues watching coins from i1th  Dima repeats the procedure above until it happens that no two coins were exchanged during this procedure Dima calls hardness of ordering the number of steps required for him according to the algorithm above to sort the sequence eg the number of times he looks through the coins from the very beginning For example for the ordered sequence hardness of ordering equals oneToday Sasha invited Dima and proposed him a game First he puts n coins in a row all of them are out of circulation Then Sasha chooses one of the coins out of circulation and replaces it with a coin in circulation for n times During this process Sasha constantly asks Dima what is the hardness of ordering of the sequence The task is more complicated because Dima should not touch the coins and he should determine hardness of ordering in his mind Help Dima with this task
