For his birthday, Kevin received the set of pairwise distinct numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n as a gift.He is going to arrange these numbers in a way such that the minimum absolute difference between two consecutive numbers be maximum possible. More formally, if he arranges numbers in order p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n, he wants to maximize the value \min \limits_{i=1}^{n - 1} \lvert p_{i + 1} - p_i \rvert, where |x| denotes the absolute value of x.Help Kevin to do that.
