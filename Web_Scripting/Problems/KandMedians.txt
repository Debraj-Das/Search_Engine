Let's denote the median of a sequence s with odd length as the value in the middle of s if we sort s in non-decreasing order. For example, let s = [1, 2, 5, 7, 2, 3, 12]. After sorting, we get sequence [1, 2, 2, \underline{3}, 5, 7, 12], and the median is equal to 3.You have a sequence of n integers [1, 2, \dots, n] and an odd integer k.In one step, you choose any k elements from the sequence and erase all chosen elements except their median. These elements do not have to go continuously (gaps are allowed between them).For example, if you have a sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] (i.e. n=7) and k = 3, then the following options for the first step are possible:  choose [1, \underline{2}, 3]; 2 is their median, so it is not erased, and the resulting sequence is [2, 4, 5, 6, 7];  choose [2, \underline{4}, 6]; 4 is their median, so it is not erased, and the resulting sequence is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7];  choose [1, \underline{6}, 7]; 6 is their median, so it is not erased, and the resulting sequence is [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];  and several others. You can do zero or more steps. Can you get a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_m after several steps?You'll be given t test cases. Solve each test case independently.
