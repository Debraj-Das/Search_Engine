A sequence (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k) is called strange, if the absolute difference between any pair of its elements is greater than or equal to the maximum element in the sequence. Formally speaking, it's strange if for every pair (i, j) with 1 \le i<j \le k, we have |a_i-a_j|\geq MAX, where MAX is the largest element of the sequence. In particular, any sequence of length at most 1 is strange.For example, the sequences (-2021, -1, -1, -1) and (-1, 0, 1) are strange, but (3, 0, 1) is not, because |0 - 1| < 3.Sifid has an array a of n integers. Sifid likes everything big, so among all the strange subsequences of a, he wants to find the length of the longest one. Can you help him?A sequence c is a subsequence of an array d if c can be obtained from d by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
