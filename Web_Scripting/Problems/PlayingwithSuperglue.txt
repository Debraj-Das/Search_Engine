Two players play a game The game is played on a rectangular board with nm squares At the beginning of the game two different squares of the board have two chips The first players goal is to shift the chips to the same square The second player aims to stop the first one with a tube of superglueWell describe the rules of the game in more detailThe players move in turns The first player beginsWith every move the first player chooses one of his unglued chips and shifts it one square to the left to the right up or down It is not allowed to move a chip beyond the board edge At the beginning of a turn some squares of the board may be covered with a glue The first player can move the chip to such square in this case the chip gets tightly glued and cannot move any longerAt each move the second player selects one of the free squares which do not contain a chip or a glue and covers it with superglue The glue dries long and squares covered with it remain sticky up to the end of the gameIf after some move of the first player both chips are in the same square then the first player wins If the first player cannot make a move both of his chips are glued then the second player wins Note that the situation where the second player cannot make a move is impossible  he can always spread the glue on the square from which the first player has just moved the chipWe will further clarify the case where both chips are glued and are in the same square In this case the first player wins as the game ends as soon as both chips are in the same square and the condition of the loss the inability to move does not ariseYou know the board sizes and the positions of the two chips on it At the beginning of the game all board squares are gluefree Find out who wins if the players play optimally
