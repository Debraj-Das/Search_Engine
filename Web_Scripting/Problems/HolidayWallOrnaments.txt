The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string a of length n. His favorite nephew has another binary string b of length m (m \leq n).Mr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer k. His nephew wants exactly k occurrences of b as substrings in a. However, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of k. So, for each k (0 \leq k \leq n - m + 1), find the minimum number of elements in a that have to be changed such that there are exactly k occurrences of b in a.A string s occurs exactly k times in t if there are exactly k different pairs (p,q) such that we can obtain s by deleting p characters from the beginning and q characters from the end of t.
