A sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters '+' and '1'. For example, sequences '(())()', '()', and '(()(()))' are balanced, while ')(', '(()', and '(()))(' are not.You are given a binary string s of length n. Construct two balanced bracket sequences a and b of length n such that for all 1\le i\le n:   if s_i=1, then a_i=b_i  if s_i=0, then a_i\ne b_i If it is impossible, you should report about it.
