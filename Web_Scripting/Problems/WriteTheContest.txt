Polycarp, Arkady's friend, prepares to the programming competition and decides to write a contest. The contest consists of n problems and lasts for T minutes. Each of the problems is defined by two positive integers a_i and p_i — its difficulty and the score awarded by its solution.Polycarp's experience suggests that his skill level is defined with positive real value s, and initially s=1.0. To solve the i-th problem Polycarp needs a_i/s minutes.Polycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by 10\%, that is skill level s decreases to 0.9s. Each episode takes exactly 10 minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for a_i/s minutes, where s is his current skill level. In calculation of a_i/s no rounding is performed, only division of integer value a_i by real value s happens.Also, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for t minutes, he increases his skill by C \cdot t, where C is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series). Duration of the training can be arbitrary real value.Polycarp is interested: what is the largest score he can get in the contest? It is allowed to solve problems in any order, while training is only allowed before solving the first problem.
