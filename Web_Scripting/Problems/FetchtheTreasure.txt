Rainbow built h cells in a row that are numbered from 1 to h from left to right There are n cells with treasure We call each of these n cells Treasure Cell The ith Treasure Cell is the aith cell and the value of treasure in it is ci dollarsThen Freda went in the first cell For now she can go just k cells forward or return to the first cell That means Freda was able to reach the 1st k1th 2k1th 3k1th cells and so onThen Rainbow gave Freda m operations Each operation is one of the following three types  Add another method x she can also go just x cells forward at any moment For example initially she has only one method k If at some moment she has methods a1a2ar then she can reach all the cells with number in form  where vi  some nonnegative integer  Reduce the value of the treasure in the xth Treasure Cell by y dollars In other words to apply assignment cxcxy  Ask the value of the most valuable treasure among the cells Freda can reach If Freda cannot reach any cell with the treasure then consider the value of the most valuable treasure equal to 0 and do nothing Otherwise take the most valuable treasure away If several Treasure Cells have the most valuable treasure take the Treasure Cell with the minimum number not necessarily with the minimum number of cell After that the total number of cells with a treasure is decreased by one As a programmer you are asked by Freda to write a program to answer each query
