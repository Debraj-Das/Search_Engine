You are given a tree with n vertices. You are allowed to modify the structure of the tree through the following multi-step operation:  Choose three vertices a, b, and c such that b is adjacent to both a and c.  For every vertex d other than b that is adjacent to a, remove the edge connecting d and a and add the edge connecting d and c.  Delete the edge connecting a and b and add the edge connecting a and c. As an example, consider the following tree:  The following diagram illustrates the sequence of steps that happen when we apply an operation to vertices 2, 4, and 5:  It can be proven that after each operation, the resulting graph is still a tree.Find the minimum number of operations that must be performed to transform the tree into a star. A star is a tree with one vertex of degree n - 1, called its center, and n - 1 vertices of degree 1.
