You are given a tree consisting of n vertices. Recall that a tree is an undirected connected acyclic graph. The given tree is rooted at the vertex 1.You have to process q queries. In each query, you are given a vertex of the tree v and an integer k.To process a query, you may delete any vertices from the tree in any order, except for the root and the vertex v. When a vertex is deleted, its children become the children of its parent. You have to process a query in such a way that maximizes the value of c(v) - m \cdot k (where c(v) is the resulting number of children of the vertex v, and m is the number of vertices you have deleted). Print the maximum possible value you can obtain.The queries are independent: the changes you make to the tree while processing a query don't affect the tree in other queries.
