A Large Software Company develops its own social network Analysts have found that during the holidays major sporting events and other significant events users begin to enter the network more frequently resulting in great load increase on the infrastructureAs part of this task we assume that the social network is 4n processes running on the n servers All servers are absolutely identical machines each of which has a volume of RAM of 1 GB  1024 MB 1 Each process takes 100 MB of RAM on the server At the same time the needs of maintaining the viability of the server takes about 100 more megabytes of RAM Thus each server may have up to 9 different processes of social networkNow each of the n servers is running exactly 4 processes However at the moment of peak load it is sometimes necessary to replicate the existing 4n processes by creating 8n new processes instead of the old ones More formally there is a set of replication rules the ith 1i4n of which has the form of aibici where ai bi and ci 1aibicin are the numbers of servers This means that instead of an old process running on server ai there should appear two new copies of the process running on servers bi and ci The two new replicated processes can be on the same server ie bi may be equal to ci or even on the same server where the original process was ie ai may be equal to bi or ci During the implementation of the rule aibici first the process from the server ai is destroyed then appears a process on the server bi then appears a process on the server ciThere is a set of 4n rules destroying all the original 4n processes from n servers and creating after their application 8n replicated processes besides on each of the n servers will be exactly 8 processes However the rules can only be applied consecutively and therefore the amount of RAM of the servers imposes limitations on the procedure for the application of the rulesAccording to this set of rules determine the order in which you want to apply all the 4n rules so that at any given time the memory of each of the servers contained at most 9 processes old and new together or tell that it is impossible
