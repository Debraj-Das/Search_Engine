This is an interactive problem!Ehab plays a game with Laggy. Ehab has 2 hidden integers (a,b). Laggy can ask a pair of integers (c,d) and Ehab will reply with:  1 if a \oplus c>b \oplus d.  0 if a \oplus c=b \oplus d.  -1 if a \oplus c<b \oplus d. Operation a \oplus b is the bitwise-xor operation of two numbers a and b.Laggy should guess (a,b) with at most 62 questions. You'll play this game. You're Laggy and the interactor is Ehab.It's guaranteed that 0 \le a,b<2^{30}.
