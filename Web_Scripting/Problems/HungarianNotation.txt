In Hungarian notation, a variable name is prefixed with a letter or a group of letters which are mnemonics for the type of that variable. For the purposes of this problem we will consider only two data types: integer and real.You are given the meaningful part of variable name in lowercase and a sample value that it will store. Integer values will be written as a sequence of digits. Real values will be written using fixed-point notation: the value is represented with a mandatory decimal point, one or more digits in the decimal part and without exponent part.Your task is to construct a name of this variable in Hungarian notation in the following way. Convert the first letter of meaningful part of the name to uppercase, and prepend a prefix: 'i' for integer variables and 'f' for real ones.
