Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for n last days: a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, where a_i is the price of berPhone on the day i.Polycarp considers the price on the day i to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if n=6 and a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], then the number of days with a bad price is 3 — these are days 2 (a_2=9), 4 (a_4=6) and 5 (a_5=7).Print the number of days with a bad price.You have to answer t independent data sets.
