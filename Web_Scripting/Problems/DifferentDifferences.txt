An array a consisting of k integers is strictly increasing if a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_k. For example, the arrays [1, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 5, 6] are strictly increasing; the arrays [2, 2], [3, 7, 5], [7, 4, 3], [1, 2, 2, 3] are not.For a strictly increasing array a of k elements, let's denote the characteristic as the number of different elements in the array [a_2 - a_1, a_3 - a_2, \dots, a_k - a_{k-1}]. For example, the characteristic of the array [1, 3, 4, 7, 8] is 3 since the array [2, 1, 3, 1] contains 3 different elements: 2, 1 and 3.You are given two integers k and n (k \le n). Construct an increasing array of k integers from 1 to n with maximum possible characteristic.
