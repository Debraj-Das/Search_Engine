A string b is a subsequence of a string a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters. For example, "xy" is a subsequence of "xzyw" and "xy", but not "yx".You are given a string a. Your task is to reorder the characters of a so that "trygub" is not a subsequence of the resulting string.In other words, you should find a string b which is a permutation of symbols of the string a and "trygub" is not a subsequence of b.We have a truly marvelous proof that any string can be arranged not to contain "trygub" as a subsequence, but this problem statement is too short to contain it.
