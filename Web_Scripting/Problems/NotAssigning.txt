You are given a tree of n vertices numbered from 1 to n, with edges numbered from 1 to n-1. A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. You have to assign integer weights to each edge of the tree, such that the resultant graph is a prime tree.A prime tree is a tree where the weight of every path consisting of one or two edges is prime. A path should not visit any vertex twice. The weight of a path is the sum of edge weights on that path.Consider the graph below. It is a prime tree as the weight of every path of two or less edges is prime. For example, the following path of two edges: 2 \to 1 \to 3 has a weight of 11 + 2 = 13, which is prime. Similarly, the path of one edge: 4 \to 3 has a weight of 5, which is also prime.  Print any valid assignment of weights such that the resultant tree is a prime tree. If there is no such assignment, then print -1. It can be proven that if a valid assignment exists, one exists with weights between 1 and 10^5 as well.
