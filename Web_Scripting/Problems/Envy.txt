For a connected undirected weighted graph G, MST (minimum spanning tree) is a subgraph of G that contains all of G's vertices, is a tree, and sum of its edges is minimum possible.You are given a graph G. If you run a MST algorithm on graph it would give you only one MST and it causes other edges to become jealous. You are given some queries, each query contains a set of edges of graph G, and you should determine whether there is a MST containing all these edges or not.
