You are given two non-empty strings s and t, consisting of Latin letters.In one move, you can choose an occurrence of the string t in the string s and replace it with dots.Your task is to remove all occurrences of the string t in the string s in the minimum number of moves, and also calculate how many different sequences of moves of the minimum length exist.Two sequences of moves are considered different if the sets of indices at which the removed occurrences of the string t in s begin differ. For example, the sets \{1, 2, 3\} and \{1, 2, 4\} are considered different, the sets \{2, 4, 6\} and \{2, 6\} — too, but sets \{3, 5\} and \{5, 3\} — not.For example, let the string s = "abababacababa" and the string t = "aba". We can remove all occurrences of the string t in 2 moves by cutting out the occurrences of the string t at the 3th and 9th positions. In this case, the string s is an example of the form "ab...bac...ba". It is also possible to cut occurrences of the string t at the 3th and 11th positions. There are two different sequences of minimum length moves.Since the answer can be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.
