A group of n merry programmers celebrate Robert Floyd's birthday. Polucarpus has got an honourable task of pouring Ber-Cola to everybody. Pouring the same amount of Ber-Cola to everybody is really important. In other words, the drink's volume in each of the n mugs must be the same.Polycarpus has already began the process and he partially emptied the Ber-Cola bottle. Now the first mug has a1 milliliters of the drink, the second one has a2 milliliters and so on. The bottle has b milliliters left and Polycarpus plans to pour them into the mugs so that the main equation was fulfilled.Write a program that would determine what volume of the drink Polycarpus needs to add into each mug to ensure that the following two conditions were fulfilled simultaneously:   there were b milliliters poured in total. That is, the bottle need to be emptied;  after the process is over, the volumes of the drink in the mugs should be equal.
