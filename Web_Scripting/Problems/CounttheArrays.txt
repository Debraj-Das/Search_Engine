Your task is to calculate the number of arrays such that:  each array contains n elements;  each element is an integer from 1 to m;  for each array, there is exactly one pair of equal elements;  for each array a, there exists an index i such that the array is strictly ascending before the i-th element and strictly descending after it (formally, it means that a_j < a_{j + 1}, if j < i, and a_j > a_{j + 1}, if j \ge i).
