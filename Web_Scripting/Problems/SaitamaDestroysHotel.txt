Saitama accidentally destroyed a hotel again. To repay the hotel company, Genos has volunteered to operate an elevator in one of its other hotels. The elevator is special — it starts on the top floor, can only move down, and has infinite capacity. Floors are numbered from 0 to s and elevator initially starts on floor s at time 0.The elevator takes exactly 1 second to move down exactly 1 floor and negligible time to pick up passengers. Genos is given a list detailing when and on which floor passengers arrive. Please determine how long in seconds it will take Genos to bring all passengers to floor 0.
