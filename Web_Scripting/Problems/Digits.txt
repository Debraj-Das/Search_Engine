John gave Jack a very hard problem He wrote a very big positive integer A0 on a piece of paper The number is less than 10200000  In each step Jack is allowed to put  signs in between some of the digits maybe none of the current number and calculate the sum of the expression He can perform the same procedure on that sum and so on The resulting sums can be labeled respectively by A1 A2 etc His task is to get to a single digit numberThe problem is that there is not much blank space on the paper There are only three lines of space so he cant perform more than three steps Since he wants to fill up the paper completely he will perform exactly three stepsJack must not add leading zeros to intermediate results but he can put  signs in front of digit 0 For example if the current number is 1000100 1000100 is a valid step resulting in number 11
