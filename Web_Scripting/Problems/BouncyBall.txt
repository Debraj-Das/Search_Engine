You are given a room that can be represented by a n \times m grid. There is a ball at position (i_1, j_1) (the intersection of row i_1 and column j_1), and it starts going diagonally in one of the four directions:  The ball is going down and right, denoted by \texttt{DR}; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from (i, j) to (i+1, j+1).  The ball is going down and left, denoted by \texttt{DL}; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from (i, j) to (i+1, j-1).  The ball is going up and right, denoted by \texttt{UR}; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from (i, j) to (i-1, j+1).  The ball is going up and left, denoted by \texttt{UL}; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from (i, j) to (i-1, j-1). After each step, the ball maintains its direction unless it hits a wall (that is, the direction takes it out of the room's bounds in the next step). In this case, the ball's direction gets flipped along the axis of the wall; if the ball hits a corner, both directions get flipped. Any instance of this is called a bounce. The ball never stops moving.  In the above example, the ball starts at (1, 7) and goes \texttt{DL} until it reaches the bottom wall, then it bounces and continues in the direction \texttt{UL}. After reaching the left wall, the ball bounces and continues to go in the direction \texttt{UR}. When the ball reaches the upper wall, it bounces and continues in the direction \texttt{DR}. After reaching the bottom-right corner, it bounces once and continues in direction \texttt{UL}, and so on.Your task is to find how many bounces the ball will go through until it reaches cell (i_2, j_2) in the room, or report that it never reaches cell (i_2, j_2) by printing -1.Note that the ball first goes in a cell and only after that bounces if it needs to.
