You are given an array a consisting of n nonnegative integersYou have to replace each 0 in a with an integer from 1 to n different elements equal to 0 can be replaced by different integersThe value of the array you obtain is the number of integers k from 1 to n such that the following condition holds there exist a pair of adjacent elements equal to k ie there exists some i in 1 n  1 such that ai  ai  1  k If there are multiple such pairs for some integer k this integer is counted in the value only onceYour task is to obtain the array with the maximum possible value
