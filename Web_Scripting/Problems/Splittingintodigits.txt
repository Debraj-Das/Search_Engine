Vasya has his favourite number n. He wants to split it to some non-zero digits. It means, that he wants to choose some digits d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k, such that 1 \leq d_i \leq 9 for all i and d_1 + d_2 + \ldots + d_k = n.Vasya likes beauty in everything, so he wants to find any solution with the minimal possible number of different digits among d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k. Help him!
