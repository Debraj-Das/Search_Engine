You have n stacks of blocks. The i-th stack contains h_i blocks and it's height is the number of blocks in it. In one move you can take a block from the i-th stack (if there is at least one block) and put it to the i + 1-th stack. Can you make the sequence of heights strictly increasing?Note that the number of stacks always remains n: stacks don't disappear when they have 0 blocks.
