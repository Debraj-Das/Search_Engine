You are given a tree of n vertices. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n.You will need to assign a weight to each edge. Let the weight of the i-th edge be a_i (1 \leq i \leq n-1). The weight of each edge should be an integer between 0 and 2^{30}-1, inclusive.You are given q conditions. Each condition consists of three integers u, v, and x. This means that the bitwise XOR of all edges on the shortest path from u to v should be x.Find out if there exist a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1} that satisfy the given conditions. If yes, print a solution such that a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{n-1} is the smallest. Here, \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.If there are multiple solutions such that a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{n-1} is the smallest, print any.
