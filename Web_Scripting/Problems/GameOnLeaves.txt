Ayush and Ashish play a game on an unrooted tree consisting of n nodes numbered 1 to n. Players make the following move in turns:   Select any leaf node in the tree and remove it together with any edge which has this node as one of its endpoints. A leaf node is a node with degree less than or equal to 1. A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.There is a special node numbered x. The player who removes this node wins the game. Ayush moves first. Determine the winner of the game if each player plays optimally.
