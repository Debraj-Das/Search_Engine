There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.Its most beautiful place is the n piles with stones numbered from 1 to n.EJOI participants have visited this place twice. When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room 108 or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.
