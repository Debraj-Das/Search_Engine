You have a tree of n vertices. You are going to convert this tree into n rubber bands on infinitely large plane. Conversion rule follows:  For every pair of vertices a and b, rubber bands a and b should intersect if and only if there is an edge exists between a and b in the tree.  Shape of rubber bands must be a simple loop. In other words, rubber band is a loop which doesn't self-intersect. Now let's define following things:   Rubber band a includes rubber band b, if and only if rubber band b is in rubber band a's area, and they don't intersect each other.  Sequence of rubber bands a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{k} (k \ge 2) are nested, if and only if for all i (2 \le i \le k), a_{i-1} includes a_{i}.   This is an example of conversion. Note that rubber bands 5 and 6 are nested. It can be proved that is it possible to make a conversion and sequence of nested rubber bands under given constraints.What is the maximum length of sequence of nested rubber bands can be obtained from given tree? Find and print it.
