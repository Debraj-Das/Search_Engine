Mrs. Smith is trying to contact her husband, John Smith, but she forgot the secret phone number!The only thing Mrs. Smith remembered was that any permutation of n can be a secret phone number. Only those permutations that minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband.The sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.The secret value of a phone number is defined as the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS). A subsequence a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots, a_{i_k} where 1\leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k\leq n is called increasing if a_{i_1} < a_{i_2} < a_{i_3} < \ldots < a_{i_k}. If a_{i_1} > a_{i_2} > a_{i_3} > \ldots > a_{i_k}, a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing/decreasing subsequences.For example, if there is a permutation [6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 3, 5], LIS of this permutation will be [1, 2, 3, 5], so the length of LIS is equal to 4. LDS can be [6, 4, 1], [6, 4, 2], or [6, 4, 3], so the length of LDS is 3.Note, the lengths of LIS and LDS can be different.So please help Mrs. Smith to find a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS.
