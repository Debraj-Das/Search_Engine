You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, consisting of n positive integers. Initially you are standing at index 1 and have a score equal to a_1. You can perform two kinds of moves:   move right — go from your current index x to x+1 and add a_{x+1} to your score. This move can only be performed if x<n.  move left — go from your current index x to x-1 and add a_{x-1} to your score. This move can only be performed if x>1. Also, you can't perform two or more moves to the left in a row. You want to perform exactly k moves. Also, there should be no more than z moves to the left among them.What is the maximum score you can achieve?
