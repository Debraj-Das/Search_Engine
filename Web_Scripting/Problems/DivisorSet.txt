You are given an integer x represented as a product of n its prime divisors p_1 \cdot p_2, \cdot \ldots \cdot p_n. Let S be the set of all positive integer divisors of x (including 1 and x itself).We call a set of integers D good if (and only if) there is no pair a \in D, b \in D such that a \ne b and a divides b.Find a good subset of S with maximum possible size. Since the answer can be large, print the size of the subset modulo 998244353.
