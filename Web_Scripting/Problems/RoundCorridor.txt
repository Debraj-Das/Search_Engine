Amugae is in a very large round corridor. The corridor consists of two areas. The inner area is equally divided by n sectors, and the outer area is equally divided by m sectors. A wall exists between each pair of sectors of same area (inner or outer), but there is no wall between the inner area and the outer area. A wall always exists at the 12 o'clock position.  The inner area's sectors are denoted as (1,1), (1,2), \dots, (1,n) in clockwise direction. The outer area's sectors are denoted as (2,1), (2,2), \dots, (2,m) in the same manner. For a clear understanding, see the example image above.Amugae wants to know if he can move from one sector to another sector. He has q questions.For each question, check if he can move between two given sectors.
