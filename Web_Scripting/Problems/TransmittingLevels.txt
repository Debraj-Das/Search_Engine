Optimizing the amount of data transmitted via a network is an important and interesting part of developing any network application  In one secret game developed deep in the ZeptoLab company the game universe consists of n levels located in a circle You can get from level i to levels i1 and i1 also you can get from level 1 to level n and vice versa The map of the ith level description size is ai bytesIn order to reduce the transmitted traffic the game gets levels as follows All the levels on the server are divided into m groups and each time a player finds himself on one of the levels of a certain group for the first time the server sends all levels of the group to the game client as a single packet Thus when a player travels inside the levels of a single group the application doesnt need any new information Due to the technical limitations the packet can contain an arbitrary number of levels but their total size mustnt exceed b bytes where b is some positive integer constantUsual situation is that players finish levels one by one thats why a decision was made to split n levels into m groups so that each group was a continuous segment containing multiple neighboring levels also the group can have two adjacent levels n and 1 Specifically if the descriptions of all levels have the total weight of at most b bytes then they can all be united into one group to be sent in a single packetDetermine what minimum number of groups do you need to make in order to organize the levels of the game observing the conditions aboveAs developing a game is a long process and technology never stagnates it is yet impossible to predict exactly what value will take constant value b limiting the packet size when the game is out Thats why the developers ask you to find the answer for multiple values of b
