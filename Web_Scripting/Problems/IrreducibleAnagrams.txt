Let's call two strings s and t anagrams of each other if it is possible to rearrange symbols in the string s to get a string, equal to t.Let's consider two strings s and t which are anagrams of each other. We say that t is a reducible anagram of s if there exists an integer k \ge 2 and 2k non-empty strings s_1, t_1, s_2, t_2, \dots, s_k, t_k that satisfy the following conditions:  If we write the strings s_1, s_2, \dots, s_k in order, the resulting string will be equal to s;  If we write the strings t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k in order, the resulting string will be equal to t;  For all integers i between 1 and k inclusive, s_i and t_i are anagrams of each other. If such strings don't exist, then t is said to be an irreducible anagram of s. Note that these notions are only defined when s and t are anagrams of each other.For example, consider the string s =  "gamegame". Then the string t =  "megamage" is a reducible anagram of s, we may choose for example s_1 =  "game", s_2 =  "gam", s_3 =  "e" and t_1 =  "mega", t_2 =  "mag", t_3 =  "e":  On the other hand, we can prove that t =  "memegaga" is an irreducible anagram of s.You will be given a string s and q queries, represented by two integers 1 \le l \le r \le |s| (where |s| is equal to the length of the string s). For each query, you should find if the substring of s formed by characters from the l-th to the r-th has at least one irreducible anagram.
