Brian the Rabbit adores chess Not long ago he argued with Stewie the Rabbit that a knight is better than a king To prove his point he tries to show that the knight is very fast but Stewie doesnt accept statements without evidence He constructed an infinite chessboard for Brian where he deleted several squares to add some more interest to the game Brian only needs to count how many different board squares a knight standing on a square with coordinates of 00 can reach in no more than k moves Naturally it is forbidden to move to the deleted squaresBrian doesnt very much like exact sciences himself and is not acquainted with programming thats why he will hardly be able to get ahead of Stewie who has already started solving the problem Help Brian to solve the problem faster than Stewie
