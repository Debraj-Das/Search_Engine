Today on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases:   They are equal.  If we split string a into two halves of the same size a1 and a2, and string b into two halves of the same size b1 and b2, then one of the following is correct:   a1 is equivalent to b1, and a2 is equivalent to b2  a1 is equivalent to b2, and a2 is equivalent to b1  As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!
