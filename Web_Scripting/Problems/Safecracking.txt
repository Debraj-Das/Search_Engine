Right now you are to solve a very, very simple problem — to crack the safe. Four positive integers stand one by one on a circle protecting the safe. You know that to unlock this striking safe you have to make all four numbers equal to one. Operations are as follows: you may choose two adjacent numbers and increase both by one; you may choose two adjacent even numbers and divide both by two. Nothing else. Crack the safe!
