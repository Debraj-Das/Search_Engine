Limak is a little polar bear. He likes nice strings — strings of length n, consisting of lowercase English letters only.The distance between two letters is defined as the difference between their positions in the alphabet. For example, , and .Also, the distance between two nice strings is defined as the sum of distances of corresponding letters. For example, , and .Limak gives you a nice string s and an integer k. He challenges you to find any nice string s' that . Find any s' satisfying the given conditions, or print "-1" if it's impossible to do so.As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use gets/scanf/printf instead of getline/cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.
