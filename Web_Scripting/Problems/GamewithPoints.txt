You are playing the following game. There are n points on a plane. They are the vertices of a regular n-polygon. Points are labeled with integer numbers from 1 to n. Each pair of distinct points is connected by a diagonal, which is colored in one of 26 colors. Points are denoted by lowercase English letters. There are three stones positioned on three distinct vertices. All stones are the same. With one move you can move the stone to another free vertex along some diagonal. The color of this diagonal must be the same as the color of the diagonal, connecting another two stones. Your goal is to move stones in such way that the only vertices occupied by stones are 1, 2 and 3. You must achieve such position using minimal number of moves. Write a program which plays this game in an optimal way.
