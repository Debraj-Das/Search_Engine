You want to build a fence that will consist of n equal sections. All sections have a width equal to 1 and height equal to k. You will place all sections in one line side by side.Unfortunately, the ground beneath the fence is not flat. For simplicity, you can think that the ground level under the i-th section is equal to h_i. You should follow several rules to build the fence:   the consecutive sections should have a common side of length at least 1;  the first and the last sections should stand on the corresponding ground levels;  the sections between may be either on the ground level or higher, but not higher than k - 1 from the ground level h_i (the height should be an integer);   One of possible fences (blue color) for the first test case Is it possible to build a fence that meets all rules?
