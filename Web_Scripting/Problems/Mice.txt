Modern researches has shown that a flock of hungry mice searching for a piece of cheese acts as follows if there are several pieces of cheese then each mouse chooses the closest one After that all mice start moving towards the chosen piece of cheese When a mouse or several mice achieve the destination point and there is still a piece of cheese in it they eat it and become wellfed Each mice that reaches this point after that remains hungry Moving speeds of all mice are equalIf there are several ways to choose closest pieces then mice will choose it in a way that would minimize the number of hungry mice To check this theory scientists decided to conduct an experiment They located N mice and M pieces of cheese on a cartesian plane where all mice are located on the line yY0 and all pieces of cheese  on another line yY1 To check the results of the experiment the scientists need a program which simulates the behavior of a flock of hungry miceWrite a program that computes the minimal number of mice which will remain hungry ie without cheese
