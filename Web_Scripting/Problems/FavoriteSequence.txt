Polycarp has a favorite sequence a[1 \dots n] consisting of n integers. He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows:  he wrote the number a_1 to the left side (at the beginning of the whiteboard);  he wrote the number a_2 to the right side (at the end of the whiteboard);  then as far to the left as possible (but to the right from a_1), he wrote the number a_3;  then as far to the right as possible (but to the left from a_2), he wrote the number a_4;  Polycarp continued to act as well, until he wrote out the entire sequence on the whiteboard.   The beginning of the result looks like this (of course, if n \ge 4). For example, if n=7 and a=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2], then Polycarp will write a sequence on the whiteboard [3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 1].You saw the sequence written on the whiteboard and now you want to restore Polycarp's favorite sequence.
