Let's denote the function f(s) that takes a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters and dots, and returns a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters as follows:  let r be an empty string;  process the characters of s from left to right. For each character c, do the following: if c is a lowercase Latin letter, append c at the end of the string r; otherwise, delete the last character from r (if r is empty before deleting the last character — the function crashes);  return r as the result of the function. You are given two strings s and t. You have to delete the minimum possible number of characters from s so that f(s) = t (and the function does not crash). Note that you aren't allowed to insert new characters into s or reorder the existing ones.
