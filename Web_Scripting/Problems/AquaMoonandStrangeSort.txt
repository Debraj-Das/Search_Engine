AquaMoon has n friends. They stand in a row from left to right, and the i-th friend from the left wears a T-shirt with a number a_i written on it. Each friend has a direction (left or right). In the beginning, the direction of each friend is right.AquaMoon can make some operations on friends. On each operation, AquaMoon can choose two adjacent friends and swap their positions. After each operation, the direction of both chosen friends will also be flipped: left to right and vice versa.AquaMoon hopes that after some operations, the numbers written on the T-shirt of n friends in the row, read from left to right, become non-decreasing. Also she wants, that all friends will have a direction of right at the end. Please find if it is possible.
