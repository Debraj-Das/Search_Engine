You are given an array a of length n consisting of integers. You can apply the following operation, consisting of several steps, on the array a zero or more times:   you select two different numbers in the array a_i and a_j;  you remove i-th and j-th elements from the array. For example, if n=6 and a=[1, 6, 1, 1, 4, 4], then you can perform the following sequence of operations:   select i=1, j=5. The array a becomes equal to [6, 1, 1, 4];  select i=1, j=2. The array a becomes equal to [1, 4]. What can be the minimum size of the array after applying some sequence of operations to it?
