There was an electronic store heist last night.All keyboards which were in the store yesterday were numbered in ascending order from some integer number x. For example, if x = 4 and there were 3 keyboards in the store, then the devices had indices 4, 5 and 6, and if x = 10 and there were 7 of them then the keyboards had indices 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.After the heist, only n keyboards remain, and they have indices a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Calculate the minimum possible number of keyboards that have been stolen. The staff remember neither x nor the number of keyboards in the store before the heist.
