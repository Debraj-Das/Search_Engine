Mahmoud was trying to solve the vertex cover problem on trees The problem statement isGiven an undirected tree consisting of n nodes find the minimum number of vertices that cover all the edges Formally we need to find a set of vertices such that for each edge uv that belongs to the tree either u is in the set or v is in the set or both are in the set Mahmoud has found the following algorithm  Root the tree at node 1  Count the number of nodes at an even depth Let it be evenCnt  Count the number of nodes at an odd depth Let it be oddCnt  The answer is the minimum between evenCnt and oddCnt The depth of a node in a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between this node and the root The depth of the root is 0Ehab told Mahmoud that this algorithm is wrong but he didnt believe because he had tested his algorithm against many trees and it worked so Ehab asked you to find 2 trees consisting of n nodes The algorithm should find an incorrect answer for the first tree and a correct answer for the second one
