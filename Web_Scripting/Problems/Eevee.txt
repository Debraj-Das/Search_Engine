You are not very into pokemons, but quick googling helped you find out, that Eevee can evolve into eight different pokemons: Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon.You know the length of the word in the crossword, and you already know some letters. Designers of the crossword made sure that the answer is unambiguous, so you can assume that exactly one pokemon out of the 8 that Eevee evolves into fits the length and the letters given.
