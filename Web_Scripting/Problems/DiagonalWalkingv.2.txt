Mikhail walks on a Cartesian plane. He starts at the point (0, 0), and in one move he can go to any of eight adjacent points. For example, if Mikhail is currently at the point (0, 0), he can go to any of the following points in one move:   (1, 0);  (1, 1);  (0, 1);  (-1, 1);  (-1, 0);  (-1, -1);  (0, -1);  (1, -1). If Mikhail goes from the point (x1, y1) to the point (x2, y2) in one move, and x1 \ne x2 and y1 \ne y2, then such a move is called a diagonal move.Mikhail has q queries. For the i-th query Mikhail's target is to go to the point (n_i, m_i) from the point (0, 0) in exactly k_i moves. Among all possible movements he want to choose one with the maximum number of diagonal moves. Your task is to find the maximum number of diagonal moves or find that it is impossible to go from the point (0, 0) to the point (n_i, m_i) in k_i moves.Note that Mikhail can visit any point any number of times (even the destination point!).
