For an array b of n integers, the extreme value of this array is the minimum number of times (possibly, zero) the following operation has to be performed to make b non-decreasing:   Select an index i such that 1 \le i \le |b|, where |b| is the current length of b.  Replace b_i with two elements x and y such that x and y both are positive integers and x + y = b_i.  This way, the array b changes and the next operation is performed on this modified array. For example, if b = [2, 4, 3] and index 2 gets selected, then the possible arrays after this operation are [2, \underline{1}, \underline{3}, 3], [2, \underline{2}, \underline{2}, 3], or [2, \underline{3}, \underline{1}, 3]. And consequently, for this array, this single operation is enough to make it non-decreasing: [2, 4, 3] \rightarrow [2, \underline{2}, \underline{2}, 3].It's easy to see that every array of positive integers can be made non-decreasing this way.YouKn0wWho has an array a of n integers. Help him find the sum of extreme values of all nonempty subarrays of a modulo 998\,244\,353. If a subarray appears in a multiple times, its extreme value should be counted the number of times it appears.An array d is a subarray of an array c if d can be obtained from c by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
