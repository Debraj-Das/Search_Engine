"The zombies are lurking outside. Waiting. Moaning. And when they come...""When they come?""I hope the Wall is high enough."Zombie attacks have hit the Wall, our line of defense in the North. Its protection is failing, and cracks are showing. In places, gaps have appeared, splitting the wall into multiple segments. We call on you for help. Go forth and explore the wall! Report how many disconnected segments there are.The wall is a two-dimensional structure made of bricks. Each brick is one unit wide and one unit high. Bricks are stacked on top of each other to form columns that are up to R bricks high. Each brick is placed either on the ground or directly on top of another brick. Consecutive non-empty columns form a wall segment. The entire wall, all the segments and empty columns in-between, is C columns wide.
