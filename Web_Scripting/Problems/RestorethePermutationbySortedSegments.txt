We guessed a permutation p consisting of n integers. The permutation of length n is the array of length n where each element from 1 to n appears exactly once. This permutation is a secret for you.For each position r from 2 to n we chose some other index l (l < r) and gave you the segment p_l, p_{l + 1}, \dots, p_r in sorted order (i.e. we rearranged the elements of this segment in a way that the elements of this segment are sorted). Thus, you are given exactly n-1 segments of the initial permutation but elements inside each segment are sorted. The segments are given to you in random order.For example, if the secret permutation is p=[3, 1, 4, 6, 2, 5] then the possible given set of segments can be:  [2, 5, 6]  [4, 6]  [1, 3, 4]  [1, 3]  [1, 2, 4, 6] Your task is to find any suitable permutation (i.e. any permutation corresponding to the given input data). It is guaranteed that the input data corresponds to some permutation (i.e. such permutation exists).You have to answer t independent test cases.
