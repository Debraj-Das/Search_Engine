This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between versions is the constraints on n and a_i. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.First, Aoi came up with the following idea for the competitive programming problem:Yuzu is a girl who collecting candies. Originally, she has x candies. There are also n enemies numbered with integers from 1 to n. Enemy i has a_i candies.Yuzu is going to determine a permutation P. A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, \{2,3,1,5,4\} is a permutation, but \{1,2,2\} is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and \{1,3,4\} is also not a permutation (because n=3 but there is the number 4 in the array).After that, she will do n duels with the enemies with the following rules:  If Yuzu has equal or more number of candies than enemy P_i, she wins the duel and gets 1 candy. Otherwise, she loses the duel and gets nothing.  The candy which Yuzu gets will be used in the next duels. Yuzu wants to win all duels. How many valid permutations P exist?This problem was easy and wasn't interesting for Akari, who is a friend of Aoi. And Akari made the following problem from the above idea:Let's define f(x) as the number of valid permutations for the integer x.You are given n, a and a prime number p \le n. Let's call a positive integer x good, if the value f(x) is not divisible by p. Find all good integers x.Your task is to solve this problem made by Akari.
