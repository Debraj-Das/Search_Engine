Police headquarter is monitoring signal on different frequency levels. They have got two suspiciously encoded strings s1 and s2 from two different frequencies as signals. They are suspecting that these two strings are from two different criminals and they are planning to do some evil task.Now they are trying to find a common substring of minimum length between these two strings. The substring must occur only once in the first string, and also it must occur only once in the second string.Given two strings s1 and s2 consist of lowercase Latin letters, find the smallest (by length) common substring p of both s1 and s2, where p is a unique substring in s1 and also in s2. See notes for formal definition of substring and uniqueness.
