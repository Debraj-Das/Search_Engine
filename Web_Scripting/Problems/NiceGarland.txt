You have a garland consisting of n lamps. Each lamp is colored red, green or blue. The color of the i-th lamp is s_i ('R', 'G' and 'B' — colors of lamps in the garland).You have to recolor some lamps in this garland (recoloring a lamp means changing its initial color to another) in such a way that the obtained garland is nice.A garland is called nice if any two lamps of the same color have distance divisible by three between them. I.e. if the obtained garland is t, then for each i, j such that t_i = t_j should be satisfied |i-j|~ mod~ 3 = 0. The value |x| means absolute value of x, the operation x~ mod~ y means remainder of x when divided by y.For example, the following garlands are nice: "RGBRGBRG", "GB", "R", "GRBGRBG", "BRGBRGB". The following garlands are not nice: "RR", "RGBG".Among all ways to recolor the initial garland to make it nice you have to choose one with the minimum number of recolored lamps. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.
