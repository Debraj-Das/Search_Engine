Once upon a time there were several little pigs and several wolves on a twodimensional grid of size nm Each cell in this grid was either empty containing one little pig or containing one wolfA little pig and a wolf are adjacent if the cells that they are located at share a side The little pigs are afraid of wolves so there will be at most one wolf adjacent to each little pig But each wolf may be adjacent to any number of little pigsThey have been living peacefully for several years But today the wolves got hungry One by one each wolf will choose one of the little pigs adjacent to it if any and eats the poor little pig This process is not repeated That is each wolf will get to eat at most one little pig Once a little pig gets eaten it disappears and cannot be eaten by any other wolfWhat is the maximum number of little pigs that may be eaten by the wolves
