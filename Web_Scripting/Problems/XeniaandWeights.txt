Xenia has a set of weights and pan scales Each weight has an integer weight from 1 to 10 kilos Xenia is going to play with scales and weights a little For this she puts weights on the scalepans one by one The first weight goes on the left scalepan the second weight goes on the right scalepan the third one goes on the left scalepan the fourth one goes on the right scalepan and so on Xenia wants to put the total of m weights on the scalepansSimply putting weights on the scales is not interesting so Xenia has set some rules First she does not put on the scales two consecutive weights of the same weight That is the weight that goes ith should be different from the i1th weight for any i 1im Second every time Xenia puts a weight on some scalepan she wants this scalepan to outweigh the other one That is the sum of the weights on the corresponding scalepan must be strictly greater than the sum on the other panYou are given all types of weights available for Xenia You can assume that the girl has an infinite number of weights of each specified type Your task is to help Xenia lay m weights on the scales or to say that it cant be done
