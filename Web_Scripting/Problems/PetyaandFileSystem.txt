Recently on a programming lesson little Petya showed how quickly he can create files and folders on the computer But he got soon fed up with this activity and he decided to do a much more useful thing He decided to calculate what folder contains most subfolders including nested folders nested folders of nested folders and so on and what folder contains most files including the files in the subfoldersMore formally the subfolders of the folder are all its directly nested folders and the subfolders of these nested folders The given folder is not considered the subfolder of itself A file is regarded as lying in a folder if and only if it either lies directly in this folder or lies in some subfolder of the folderFor a better understanding of how to count subfolders and files for calculating the answer see notes and answers to the samplesYou are given a few files that Petya has managed to create The path to each file looks as followsdiskNamefolder1folder2 foldernfileName  diskName is single capital letter from the set CDEFG folder1  foldern are folder names Each folder name is nonempty sequence of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9 n1 fileName is a file name in the form of nameextension where the name and the extension are nonempty sequences of lowercase Latin letters and digits from 0 to 9 It is also known that there is no file whose path looks like diskNamefileName That is each file is stored in some folder but there are no files directly in the root Also let us assume that the disk root is not a folderHelp Petya to find the largest number of subfolders which can be in some folder and the largest number of files that can be in some folder counting all its subfolders
