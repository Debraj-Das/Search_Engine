In the capital city of Berland Bertown demonstrations are against the recent election of the King of Berland Berland opposition led by Mr Ovalny believes that the elections were not fair enough and wants to organize a demonstration at one of the squaresBertown has n squares numbered from 1 to n they are numbered in the order of increasing distance between them and the city center That is square number 1 is central and square number n is the farthest from the center Naturally the opposition wants to hold a meeting as close to the city center as possible that is they want an square with the minimum numberThere are exactly k kn days left before the demonstration Now all squares are free But the Bertown city administration never sleeps and the approval of an application for the demonstration threatens to become a very complex process The process of approval lasts several days but every day the following procedure takes place  The opposition shall apply to hold a demonstration at a free square the one which isnt used by the administration  The administration tries to move the demonstration to the worst free square left To do this the administration organizes some longterm activities on the square which is specified in the application of opposition In other words the administration starts using the square and it is no longer free Then the administration proposes to move the opposition demonstration to the worst free square If the opposition has applied for the worst free square then request is accepted and administration doesnt spend money If the administration does not have enough money to organize an event on the square in question the oppositions application is accepted If administration doesnt have enough money to organize activity then rest of administrations money spends and application is accepted  If the application is not accepted then the opposition can agree to the administrations proposal that is take the worst free square or withdraw the current application and submit another one the next day If there are no more days left before the meeting the opposition has no choice but to agree to the proposal of City Hall If application is accepted opposition can reject it It means than opposition still can submit more applications later but square remains free In order to organize an event on the square i the administration needs to spend ai bourles Because of the crisis the administration has only b bourles to confront the opposition What is the best square that the opposition can take if the administration will keep trying to occupy the square in question each time Note that the administrations actions always depend only on the actions of the opposition
