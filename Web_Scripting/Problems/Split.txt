One day, BThero decided to play around with arrays and came up with the following problem:You are given an array a, which consists of n positive integers. The array is numerated 1 through n. You execute the following procedure exactly once:  You create a new array b which consists of 2n positive integers, where for each 1 \le i \le n the condition b_{2i-1}+b_{2i} = a_i holds. For example, for the array a = [6, 8, 2] you can create b = [2, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1].  You merge consecutive equal numbers in b. For example, b = [2, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1] becomes b = [2, 4, 1]. Find and print the minimum possible value of |b| (size of b) which can be achieved at the end of the procedure. It can be shown that under the given constraints there is at least one way to construct b.
