You are given a positive integer n. Since n may be very large, you are given its binary representation.You should compute the number of triples (a,b,c) with 0 \leq a,b,c \leq n such that a \oplus b, b \oplus c, and a \oplus c are the sides of a non-degenerate triangle. Here, \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.You should output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353.Three positive values x, y, and z are the sides of a non-degenerate triangle if and only if x+y>z, x+z>y, and y+z>x.
