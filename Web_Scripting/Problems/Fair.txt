Some company is going to hold a fair in Byteland. There are n towns in Byteland and m two-way roads between towns. Of course, you can reach any town from any other town using roads.There are k types of goods produced in Byteland and every town produces only one type. To hold a fair you have to bring at least s different types of goods. It costs d(u,v) coins to bring goods from town u to town v where d(u,v) is the length of the shortest path from u to v. Length of a path is the number of roads in this path.The organizers will cover all travel expenses but they can choose the towns to bring goods from. Now they want to calculate minimum expenses to hold a fair in each of n towns.
