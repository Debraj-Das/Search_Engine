Alice and Bob are playing a game with strings. There will be t rounds in the game. In each round, there will be a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. Alice moves first and both the players take alternate turns. Alice is allowed to remove any substring of even length (possibly empty) and Bob is allowed to remove any substring of odd length from s.More formally, if there was a string s = s_1s_2 \ldots s_k the player can choose a substring s_ls_{l+1} \ldots s_{r-1}s_r with length of corresponding parity and remove it. After that the string will become s = s_1 \ldots s_{l-1}s_{r+1} \ldots s_k.After the string becomes empty, the round ends and each player calculates his/her score for this round. The score of a player is the sum of values of all characters removed by him/her. The value of \texttt{a} is 1, the value of \texttt{b} is 2, the value of \texttt{c} is 3, \ldots, and the value of \texttt{z} is 26. The player with higher score wins the round. For each round, determine the winner and the difference between winner's and loser's scores. Assume that both players play optimally to maximize their score. It can be proved that a draw is impossible.
