Berland has n cities the capital is located in city s and the historic home town of the President is in city t st The cities are connected by oneway roads the travel time for each of the road is a positive integerOnce a year the President visited his historic home town t for which his motorcade passes along some path from s to t he always returns on a personal plane Since the president is a very busy man he always chooses the path from s to t along which he will travel the fastestThe ministry of Roads and Railways wants to learn for each of the road whether the President will definitely pass through it during his travels and if not whether it is possible to repair it so that it would definitely be included in the shortest path from the capital to the historic home town of the President Obviously the road can not be repaired so that the travel time on it was less than one The ministry of Berland like any other is interested in maintaining the budget so it wants to know the minimum cost of repairing the road Also it is very fond of accuracy so it repairs the roads so that the travel time on them is always a positive integer
