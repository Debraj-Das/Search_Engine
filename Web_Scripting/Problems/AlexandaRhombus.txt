While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a n-th order rhombus in a cell grid.A 1-st order rhombus is just a square 1 \times 1 (i.e just a cell).A n-th order rhombus for all n \geq 2 one obtains from a n-1-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).  Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a n-th order rhombus.
