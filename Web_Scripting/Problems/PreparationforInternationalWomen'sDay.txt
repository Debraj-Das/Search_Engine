International Women's Day is coming soon! Polycarp is preparing for the holiday.There are n candy boxes in the shop for sale. The i-th box contains d_i candies.Polycarp wants to prepare the maximum number of gifts for k girls. Each gift will consist of exactly two boxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by k. In other words, two boxes i and j (i \ne j) can be combined as a gift if d_i + d_j is divisible by k.How many boxes will Polycarp be able to give? Of course, each box can be a part of no more than one gift. Polycarp cannot use boxes "partially" or redistribute candies between them.
