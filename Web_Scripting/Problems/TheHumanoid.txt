There are n astronauts working on some space station. An astronaut with the number i (1 \le i \le n) has power a_i.An evil humanoid has made his way to this space station. The power of this humanoid is equal to h. Also, the humanoid took with him two green serums and one blue serum.In one second , a humanoid can do any of three actions:  to absorb an astronaut with power strictly less humanoid power;  to use green serum, if there is still one left;  to use blue serum, if there is still one left. When an astronaut with power a_i is absorbed, this astronaut disappears, and power of the humanoid increases by \lfloor \frac{a_i}{2} \rfloor, that is, an integer part of \frac{a_i}{2}. For example, if a humanoid absorbs an astronaut with power 4, its power increases by 2, and if a humanoid absorbs an astronaut with power 7, its power increases by 3.After using the green serum, this serum disappears, and the power of the humanoid doubles, so it increases by 2 times.After using the blue serum, this serum disappears, and the power of the humanoid triples, so it increases by 3 times.The humanoid is wondering what the maximum number of astronauts he will be able to absorb if he acts optimally.
