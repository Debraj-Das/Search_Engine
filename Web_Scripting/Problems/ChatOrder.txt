Polycarp is a big lover of killing time in social networks. A page with a chatlist in his favourite network is made so that when a message is sent to some friend, his friend's chat rises to the very top of the page. The relative order of the other chats doesn't change. If there was no chat with this friend before, then a new chat is simply inserted to the top of the list.Assuming that the chat list is initially empty, given the sequence of Polycaprus' messages make a list of chats after all of his messages are processed. Assume that no friend wrote any message to Polycarpus.
