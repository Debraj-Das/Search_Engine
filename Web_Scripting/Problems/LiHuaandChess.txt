This is an interactive problem.Li Ming and Li Hua are playing a game. Li Hua has a chessboard of size n\times m. Denote (r, c) (1\le r\le n, 1\le c\le m) as the cell on the r-th row from the top and on the c-th column from the left. Li Ming put a king on the chessboard and Li Hua needs to guess its position.Li Hua can ask Li Ming no more than 3 questions. In each question, he can choose a cell and ask the minimum steps needed to move the king to the chosen cell. Each question is independent, which means the king doesn't actually move.A king can move from (x,y) to (x',y') if and only if \max\{|x-x'|,|y-y'|\}=1 (shown in the following picture).  The position of the king is chosen before the interaction.Suppose you were Li Hua, please solve this problem.
