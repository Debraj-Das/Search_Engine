Bessie is out grazing on the farm, which consists of n fields connected by m bidirectional roads. She is currently at field 1, and will return to her home at field n at the end of the day.The Cowfederation of Barns has ordered Farmer John to install one extra bidirectional road. The farm has k special fields and he has decided to install the road between two different special fields. He may add the road between two special fields that already had a road directly connecting them.After the road is added, Bessie will return home on the shortest path from field 1 to field n. Since Bessie needs more exercise, Farmer John must maximize the length of this shortest path. Help him!
