You are given two integers l and r (l \le r). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from l to r (including l and r) such that each number contains at most k different digits, and print this sum modulo 998244353.For example, if k = 1 then you have to calculate all numbers from l to r such that each number is formed using only one digit. For l = 10, r = 50 the answer is 11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110.
