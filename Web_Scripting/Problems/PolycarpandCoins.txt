Polycarp must pay exactly n burles at the checkout He has coins of two nominal values 1 burle and 2 burles Polycarp likes both kinds of coins equally So he doesnt want to pay with more coins of one type than with the otherThus Polycarp wants to minimize the difference between the count of coins of 1 burle and 2 burles being used Help him by determining two nonnegative integer values c1 and c2 which are the number of coins of 1 burle and 2 burles respectively so that the total value of that number of coins is exactly n ie c1  2 cdot c2  n and the absolute value of the difference between c1 and c2 is as little as possible ie you must minimize c1c2
