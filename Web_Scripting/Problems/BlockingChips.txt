You are given a tree, consisting of n vertices. There are k chips, placed in vertices a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k. All a_i are distinct. Vertices a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k are colored black initially. The remaining vertices are white.You are going to play a game where you perform some moves (possibly, zero). On the i-th move (1-indexed) you are going to move the ((i - 1) \bmod k + 1)-st chip from its current vertex to an adjacent white vertex and color that vertex black. So, if k=3, you move chip 1 on move 1, chip 2 on move 2, chip 3 on move 3, chip 1 on move 4, chip 2 on move 5 and so on. If there is no adjacent white vertex, then the game ends.What's the maximum number of moves you can perform?
