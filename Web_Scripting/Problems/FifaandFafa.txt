Fifa and Fafa are sharing a flat Fifa loves video games and wants to download a new soccer game Unfortunately Fafa heavily uses the internet which consumes the quota Fifa can access the internet through his WiFi access point This access point can be accessed within a range of r meters this range can be chosen by Fifa from its position Fifa must put the access point inside the flat which has a circular shape of radius R Fifa wants to minimize the area that is not covered by the access point inside the flat without letting Fafa or anyone outside the flat to get access to the internetThe world is represented as an infinite 2D plane The flat is centered at x1y1 and has radius R and Fafas laptop is located at x2y2 not necessarily inside the flat Find the position and the radius chosen by Fifa for his access point which minimizes the uncovered area
