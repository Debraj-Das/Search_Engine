As you know the most intelligent beings on the Earth are of course cows This conclusion was reached long ago by the Martian aliens as well as a number of other intelligent civilizations from outer space Sometimes cows gather into cowavans This seems to be seasonal But at this time the cows become passive and react poorly to external stimuli A cowavan is a perfect target for the Martian scientific saucer its time for largescale abductions or as the Martians say raids Simply put a cowavan is a set of cows in a row If we number all cows in the cowavan with positive integers from 1 to n then we can formalize the popular model of abduction known as the abCowavan Raid first they steal a cow number a then number ab then  number a2b and so on until the number of an abducted cow exceeds n During one raid the cows are not renumbered The aliens would be happy to place all the cows on board of their hospitable ship but unfortunately the amount of cargo space is very very limited The researchers knowing the mass of each cow in the cowavan made p scenarios of the abraid Now they want to identify the following thing for each scenario individually what total mass of pure beef will get on board of the ship All the scenarios are independent in the process of performing the calculations the cows are not being stolen
