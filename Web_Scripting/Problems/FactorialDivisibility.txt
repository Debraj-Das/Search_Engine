You are given an integer x and an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. You have to determine if the number a_1! + a_2! + \ldots + a_n! is divisible by x!.Here k! is a factorial of k — the product of all positive integers less than or equal to k. For example, 3! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6, and 5! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120.
