Hacker Zhorik wants to decipher two secret messages he intercepted yesterday Yeah message is a sequence of encrypted blocks each of them consists of several bytes of informationZhorik knows that each of the messages is an archive containing one or more files Zhorik knows how each of these archives was transferred through the network if an archive consists of k files of sizes l1l2lk bytes then the ith file is split to one or more blocks bi1bi2bimi here the total length of the blocks bi1bi2bimi is equal to the length of the file li and after that all blocks are transferred through the network maintaining the order of files in the archiveZhorik thinks that the two messages contain the same archive because their total lengths are equal However each file can be split in blocks in different ways in the two messagesYou are given the lengths of blocks in each of the two messages Help Zhorik to determine what is the maximum number of files could be in the archive if the Zhoriks assumption is correct
