There are n persons who initially don't know each other. On each morning, two of them, who were not friends before, become friends.We want to plan a trip for every evening of m days. On each trip, you have to select a group of people that will go on the trip. For every person, one of the following should hold:   Either this person does not go on the trip,  Or at least k of his friends also go on the trip. Note that the friendship is not transitive. That is, if a and b are friends and b and c are friends, it does not necessarily imply that a and c are friends.For each day, find the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on that day.
