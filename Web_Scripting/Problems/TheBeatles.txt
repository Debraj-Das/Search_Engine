Recently a Golden Circle of Beetlovers was found in Byteland. It is a circle route going through n \cdot k cities. The cities are numerated from 1 to n \cdot k, the distance between the neighboring cities is exactly 1 km.Sergey does not like beetles, he loves burgers. Fortunately for him, there are n fast food restaurants on the circle, they are located in the 1-st, the (k + 1)-st, the (2k + 1)-st, and so on, the ((n-1)k + 1)-st cities, i.e. the distance between the neighboring cities with fast food restaurants is k km.Sergey began his journey at some city s and traveled along the circle, making stops at cities each l km (l > 0), until he stopped in s once again. Sergey then forgot numbers s and l, but he remembers that the distance from the city s to the nearest fast food restaurant was a km, and the distance from the city he stopped at after traveling the first l km from s to the nearest fast food restaurant was b km. Sergey always traveled in the same direction along the circle, but when he calculated distances to the restaurants, he considered both directions.Now Sergey is interested in two integers. The first integer x is the minimum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to s. The second integer y is the maximum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to s.
