You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters and q queries for this string.Recall that the substring s[l; r] of the string s is the string s_l s_{l + 1} \dots s_r. For example, the substrings of "codeforces" are "code", "force", "f", "for", but not "coder" and "top".There are two types of queries:   1~ pos~ c (1 \le pos \le |s|, c is lowercase Latin letter): replace s_{pos} with c (set s_{pos} := c);  2~ l~ r (1 \le l \le r \le |s|): calculate the number of distinct characters in the substring s[l; r].
