One day Vasya was going home when he saw a box lying on the road The box can be represented as a rectangular parallelepiped Vasya needed no time to realize that the box is special as all its edges are parallel to the coordinate axes one of its vertices is at point 000 and the opposite one is at point x1y1z1 The six faces of the box contain some numbers a1a2a6 exactly one number right in the center of each face  The numbers are located on the box like that   number a1 is written on the face that lies on the ZOX plane  a2 is written on the face parallel to the plane from the previous point  a3 is written on the face that lies on the XOY plane  a4 is written on the face parallel to the plane from the previous point  a5 is written on the face that lies on the YOZ plane  a6 is written on the face parallel to the plane from the previous point At the moment Vasya is looking at the box from point xyz Find the sum of numbers that Vasya sees Note that all faces of the box are not transparent and Vasya cant see the numbers through the box The picture contains transparent faces just to make it easier to perceive You can consider that if Vasya is looking from point lying on the plane of some face than he can not see the number that is written on this face It is enough to see the center of a face to see the corresponding number for Vasya Also note that Vasya always reads correctly the ai numbers that he sees independently of their rotation angle and other factors that is for example if Vasya sees some ai6 then he cant mistake this number for 9 and so on
