Petya likes horse racing very much Horses numbered from l to r take part in the races Petya wants to evaluate the probability of victory for some reason to do that he needs to know the amount of nearly lucky horses numbers A nearly lucky number is an integer number that has at least two lucky digits the distance between which does not exceed k Petya learned from some of his mates from Lviv that lucky digits are digits 4 and 7 The distance between the digits is the absolute difference between their positions in the number of a horse For example if k2 then numbers 412395497 404 4070400000070004007 are nearly lucky and numbers 4 4123954997 4007000040070004007 are notPetya prepared t intervals liri and invented number k common for all of them Your task is to find how many nearly happy numbers there are in each of these segments Since the answers can be quite large output them modulo 1000000007 1097
