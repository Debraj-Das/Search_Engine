Piegirl was asked to implement two table join operation for distributed database system, minimizing the network traffic.Suppose she wants to join two tables, A and B. Each of them has certain number of rows which are distributed on different number of partitions. Table A is distributed on the first cluster consisting of m partitions. Partition with index i has ai rows from A. Similarly, second cluster containing table B has n partitions, i-th one having bi rows from B. In one network operation she can copy one row from any partition to any other partition. At the end, for each row from A and each row from B there should be a partition that has both rows. Determine the minimal number of network operations to achieve this.
