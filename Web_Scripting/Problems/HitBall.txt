When Valera was playing football on a stadium it suddenly began to rain Valera hid in the corridor under the grandstand not to get wet However the desire to play was so great that he decided to train his hitting the ball right in this corridor Valera went back far enough put the ball and hit it The ball bounced off the walls the ceiling and the floor corridor and finally hit the exit door As the ball was wet it left a spot on the door Now Valera wants to know the coordinates for this spotLets describe the event more formally The ball will be considered a point in space The door of the corridor will be considered a rectangle located on plane xOz such that the lower left corner of the door is located at point 000 and the upper right corner is located at point a0b  The corridor will be considered as a rectangular parallelepiped infinite in the direction of increasing coordinates of y In this corridor the floor will be considered as plane xOy and the ceiling as plane parallel to xOy and passing through point a0b We will also assume that one of the walls is plane yOz and the other wall is plane parallel to yOz and passing through point a0bWell say that the ball hit the door when its coordinate y was equal to 0 Thus the coordinates of the spot are point x00z0 where 0x0a0z0b To hit the ball Valera steps away from the door at distance m and puts the ball in the center of the corridor at point  After the hit the ball flies at speed vxvyvz This means that if the ball has coordinates xyz then after one second it will have coordinates xvxyvyzvzSee image in notes for clarificationWhen the ball collides with the ceiling the floor or a wall of the corridor it bounces off in accordance with the laws of reflection the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection In the problem we consider the ideal physical model so we can assume that there is no air resistance friction force or any loss of energy
