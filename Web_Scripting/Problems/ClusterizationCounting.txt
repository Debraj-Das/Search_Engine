There are n computers in the company network. They are numbered from 1 to n.For each pair of two computers 1 \leq i < j \leq n you know the value a_{i,j}: the difficulty of sending data between computers i and j. All values a_{i,j} for i<j are different.You want to separate all computers into k sets A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k, such that the following conditions are satisfied:   for each computer 1 \leq i \leq n there is exactly one set A_j, such that i \in A_j;  for each two pairs of computers (s, f) and (x, y) (s \neq f, x \neq y), such that s, f, x are from the same set but x and y are from different sets, a_{s,f} < a_{x,y}. For each 1 \leq k \leq n find the number of ways to divide computers into k groups, such that all required conditions are satisfied. These values can be large, so you need to find them by modulo 998\,244\,353.
