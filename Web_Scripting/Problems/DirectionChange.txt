You are given a grid with n rows and m columns. Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to n, and from 1 to m. The intersection of the a-th row and b-th column is denoted by (a, b). Initially, you are standing in the top left corner (1, 1). Your goal is to reach the bottom right corner (n, m).You can move in four directions from (a, b): up to (a-1, b), down to (a+1, b), left to (a, b-1) or right to (a, b+1).You cannot move in the same direction in two consecutive moves, and you cannot leave the grid. What is the minimum number of moves to reach (n, m)?
