Paw the Spider is making a web Webmaking is a real art Paw has been learning to do it his whole life Lets consider the structure of the web  There are n main threads going from the center of the web All main threads are located in one plane and divide it into n equal infinite sectors The sectors are indexed from 1 to n in the clockwise direction Sectors i and i1 are adjacent for every i 1in In addition sectors 1 and n are also adjacentSome sectors have bridge threads Each bridge connects the two main threads that make up this sector The points at which the bridge is attached to the main threads will be called attachment points Both attachment points of a bridge are at the same distance from the center of the web At each attachment point exactly one bridge is attached The bridges are adjacent if they are in the same sector and there are no other bridges between themA cell of the web is a trapezoid which is located in one of the sectors and is bounded by two main threads and two adjacent bridges You can see that the sides of the cell may have the attachment points of bridges from adjacent sectors If the number of attachment points on one side of the cell is not equal to the number of attachment points on the other side it creates an imbalance of pulling forces on this cell and this may eventually destroy the entire web Well call such a cell unstable The perfect web does not contain unstable cellsUnstable cells are marked red in the figure Stable cells are marked greenPaw the Spider isnt a skillful webmaker yet he is only learning to make perfect webs Help Paw to determine the number of unstable cells in the web he has just spun
