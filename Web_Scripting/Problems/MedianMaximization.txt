You are given two positive integers n and s. Find the maximum possible median of an array of n non-negative integers (not necessarily distinct), such that the sum of its elements is equal to s.A median of an array of integers of length m is the number standing on the \lceil {\frac{m}{2}} \rceil-th (rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting from 1. For example, a median of the array [20,40,20,50,50,30] is the \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil-th element of [20,20,30,40,50,50], so it is 30. There exist other definitions of the median, but in this problem we use the described definition.
