Suppose there is a h \times w grid consisting of empty or full cells. Let's make some definitions:  r_{i} is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the left side in the i-th row (1 \le i \le h). In particular, r_i=0 if the leftmost cell of the i-th row is empty.  c_{j} is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the top end in the j-th column (1 \le j \le w). In particular, c_j=0 if the topmost cell of the j-th column is empty. In other words, the i-th row starts exactly with r_i full cells. Similarly, the j-th column starts exactly with c_j full cells.  These are the r and c values of some 3 \times 4 grid. Black cells are full and white cells are empty. You have values of r and c. Initially, all cells are empty. Find the number of ways to fill grid cells to satisfy values of r and c. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo 1000000007\,(10^{9} + 7). In other words, find the remainder after division of the answer by 1000000007\,(10^{9} + 7).
