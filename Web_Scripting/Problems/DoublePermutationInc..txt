Polycarp recently became an employee of the company "Double Permutation Inc." Now he is a fan of permutations and is looking for them everywhere!A permutation in this problem is a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k such that every integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once in it. For example, the following sequences are permutations of [3, 1, 4, 2], [1] and [6, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4]. The following sequences are not permutations: [0, 1], [1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 4] and [2, 3].In the lobby of the company's headquarter statistics on visits to the company's website for the last n days are published — the sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Polycarp wants to color all the elements of this sequence in one of three colors (red, green or blue) so that:  all red numbers, being written out of a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n from left to right (that is, without changing their relative order), must form some permutation (let's call it P);  all green numbers, being written out of a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n from left to right (that is, without changing their relative order), must form the same permutation P;  among blue numbers there should not be elements that are equal to some element of the permutation P. Help Polycarp to color all n numbers so that the total number of red and green elements is maximum.
