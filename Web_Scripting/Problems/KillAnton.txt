After rejecting 10^{100} data structure problems, Errorgorn is very angry at Anton and decided to kill him.Anton's DNA can be represented as a string a which only contains the characters "ANTON" (there are only 4 distinct characters). Errorgorn can change Anton's DNA into string b which must be a permutation of a. However, Anton's body can defend against this attack. In 1 second, his body can swap 2 adjacent characters of his DNA to transform it back to a. Anton's body is smart and will use the minimum number of moves.To maximize the chance of Anton dying, Errorgorn wants to change Anton's DNA the string that maximizes the time for Anton's body to revert his DNA. But since Errorgorn is busy making more data structure problems, he needs your help to find the best string B. Can you help him?
