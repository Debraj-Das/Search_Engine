You are given a chessboard of size n \times n. It is filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in the following way: the first \lceil \frac{n^2}{2} \rceil numbers from 1 to \lceil \frac{n^2}{2} \rceil are written in the cells with even sum of coordinates from left to right from top to bottom. The rest n^2 - \lceil \frac{n^2}{2} \rceil numbers from \lceil \frac{n^2}{2} \rceil + 1 to n^2 are written in the cells with odd sum of coordinates from left to right from top to bottom. The operation \lceil\frac{x}{y}\rceil means division x by y rounded up.For example, the left board on the following picture is the chessboard which is given for n=4 and the right board is the chessboard which is given for n=5.  You are given q queries. The i-th query is described as a pair x_i, y_i. The answer to the i-th query is the number written in the cell x_i, y_i (x_i is the row, y_i is the column). Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to n.
