Lets call an array good if there is an element in the array that equals to the sum of all other elements For example the array a1 3 3 7 is good because there is the element a47 which equals to the sum 1  3  3You are given an array a consisting of n integers Your task is to print all indices j of this array such that after removing the jth element from the array it will be good lets call such indices niceFor example if a8 3 5 2 the nice indices are 1 and 4   if you remove a1 the array will look like 3 5 2 and it is good  if you remove a4 the array will look like 8 3 5 and it is good You have to consider all removals independently ie remove the element check if the resulting array is good and return the element into the array
