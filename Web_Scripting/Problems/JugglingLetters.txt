You are given n strings s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.In one operation you can remove a character from a string s_i and insert it to an arbitrary position in a string s_j (j may be equal to i). You may perform this operation any number of times. Is it possible to make all n strings equal?
