A new bus route is opened in the city  The route is a closed polygon line in the place with all segments parallel to one of the axes m buses will operate on the route All buses move in a loop along the route in the same direction with equal constant velocities stopping times are negligible in this problemBuses start their movement in the first vertex of the route with equal interval Suppose that T is the total time for a single bus to travel the whole loop of the route Then the bus 1 starts moving at time 0 the bus 2 starts at time Tm the bus 3 starts at time 2Tm and so on finally the bus m starts moving at time m1Tm Thus all intervals between pairs of consecutive buses including the interval between the last and the first bus are equalBuses can communicate with each other via wireless transmitters of equal power If the transmitters have power D then only buses within distance D of each other can communicateThe buses are also equipped with a distributed system of schedule tracking For all buses to stick to the schedule the system has to synchronize the necessary data between all buses from time to time At the moment of synchronization the bus 1 communicates with the bus 2 the bus 2 with bus 3 and so on also the bus m communicates with the bus 1As a research employee you are tasked with finding the smallest value of D such that it is possible to find a time moment to perform synchronization once all buses have started moving
