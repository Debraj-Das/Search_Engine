Let's say string s has period k if s_i = s_{i + k} for all i from 1 to |s| - k (|s| means length of string s) and k is the minimum positive integer with this property.Some examples of a period: for s="0101" the period is k=2, for s="0000" the period is k=1, for s="010" the period is k=2, for s="0011" the period is k=4.You are given string t consisting only of 0's and 1's and you need to find such string s that:  String s consists only of 0's and 1's;  The length of s doesn't exceed 2 \cdot |t|;  String t is a subsequence of string s;  String s has smallest possible period among all strings that meet conditions 1—3. Let us recall that t is a subsequence of s if t can be derived from s by deleting zero or more elements (any) without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, t="011" is a subsequence of s="10101".
