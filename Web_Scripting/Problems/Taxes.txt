Mr Funt now lives in a country with a very specific tax laws The total income of mr Funt during this year is equal to n n2 burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of n not equal to n of course For example if n6 then Funt has to pay 3 burles while for n25 he needs to pay 5 and if n2 he pays only 1 burleAs mr Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit In particular he wants to split the initial n in several parts n1n2nkn here k is arbitrary even k1 is allowed and pay the taxes for each part separately He cant make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him So the condition ni2 should hold for all i from 1 to kOstap Bender wonders how many money Funt has to pay ie minimal if he chooses and optimal way to split n in parts
