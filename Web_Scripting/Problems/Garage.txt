Pak Chanek plans to build a garage. He wants the garage to consist of a square and a right triangle that are arranged like the following illustration.  Define a and b as the lengths of two of the sides in the right triangle as shown in the illustration. An integer x is suitable if and only if we can construct a garage with assigning positive integer values for the lengths a and b (a<b) so that the area of the square at the bottom is exactly x. As a good friend of Pak Chanek, you are asked to help him find the N-th smallest suitable number.
