Yura owns a quite ordinary and boring array a of length n. You think there is nothing more boring than that, but Vladik doesn't agree!In order to make Yura's array even more boring, Vladik makes q boring queries. Each query consists of two integers x and y. Before answering a query, the bounds l and r for this query are calculated: l = (last + x) \bmod n + 1, r = (last + y) \bmod n + 1, where last is the answer on the previous query (zero initially), and \bmod is the remainder operation. Whenever l > r, they are swapped.After Vladik computes l and r for a query, he is to compute the least common multiple (LCM) on the segment [l; r] of the initial array a modulo 10^9 + 7. LCM of a multiset of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the elements of the multiset. The obtained LCM is the answer for this query.Help Vladik and compute the answer for each query!
