There are n positive integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. For the one move you can choose any even value c and divide by two all elements that equal c.For example, if a=[6,8,12,6,3,12] and you choose c=6, and a is transformed into a=[3,8,12,3,3,12] after the move.You need to find the minimal number of moves for transforming a to an array of only odd integers (each element shouldn't be divisible by 2).
