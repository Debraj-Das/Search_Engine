You have an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where a_i = i.In one step, you can choose two indices x and y (x \neq y) and set a_x = \left\lceil \frac{a_x}{a_y} \right\rceil (ceiling function).Your goal is to make array a consist of n - 1 ones and 1 two in no more than n + 5 steps. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of steps.
