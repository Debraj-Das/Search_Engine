You are given an array a of n integers.Find two permutations^\dagger p and q of length n such that \max(p_i,q_i)=a_i for all 1 \leq i \leq n or report that such p and q do not exist.^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
