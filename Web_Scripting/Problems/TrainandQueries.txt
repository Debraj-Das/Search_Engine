Along the railroad there are stations indexed from 1 to 10^9. An express train always travels along a route consisting of n stations with indices u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n, where (1 \le u_i \le 10^9). The train travels along the route from left to right. It starts at station u_1, then stops at station u_2, then at u_3, and so on. Station u_n — the terminus.It is possible that the train will visit the same station more than once. That is, there may be duplicates among the values u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n.You are given k queries, each containing two different integers a_j and b_j (1 \le a_j, b_j \le 10^9). For each query, determine whether it is possible to travel by train from the station with index a_j to the station with index b_j.For example, let the train route consist of 6 of stations with indices [3, 7, 1, 5, 1, 4] and give 3 of the following queries:   a_1 = 3, b_1 = 5It is possible to travel from station 3 to station 5 by taking a section of the route consisting of stations [3, 7, 1, 5]. Answer: YES.  a_2 = 1, b_2 = 7You cannot travel from station 1 to station 7 because the train cannot travel in the opposite direction. Answer: NO.  a_3 = 3, b_3 = 10It is not possible to travel from station 3 to station 10 because station 10 is not part of the train's route. Answer: NO.
