You are given n strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.String a is a substring of string b if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in b in such a way that they form a. For example, string "for" is contained as a substring in strings "codeforces", "for" and "therefore", but is not contained as a substring in strings "four", "fofo" and "rof".
