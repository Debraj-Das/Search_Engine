You're given an undirected graph with n nodes and m edges. Nodes are numbered from 1 to n.The graph is considered harmonious if and only if the following property holds:  For every triple of integers (l, m, r) such that 1 \le l < m < r \le n, if there exists a path going from node l to node r, then there exists a path going from node l to node m. In other words, in a harmonious graph, if from a node l we can reach a node r through edges (l < r), then we should able to reach nodes (l+1), (l+2), \ldots, (r-1) too.What is the minimum number of edges we need to add to make the graph harmonious?
