Ivan unexpectedly saw a present from one of his previous birthdays. It is array of n numbers from 1 to 200. Array is old and some numbers are hard to read. Ivan remembers that for all elements at least one of its neighbours ls not less than it, more formally:a_{1} \le a_{2},a_{n} \le a_{n-1} anda_{i} \le max(a_{i-1}, \,\, a_{i+1}) for all i from 2 to n-1.Ivan does not remember the array and asks to find the number of ways to restore it. Restored elements also should be integers from 1 to 200. Since the number of ways can be big, print it modulo 998244353.
