Hossam bought a new piece of ground with length n and width m, he divided it into an n \cdot m grid, each cell being of size 1\times1.Since Hossam's name starts with the letter 'H', he decided to draw the capital letter 'H' by building walls of size 1\times1 on some squares of the ground. Each square 1\times1 on the ground is assigned a quality degree: perfect, medium, or bad.The process of building walls to form up letter 'H' has the following constraints:  The letter must consist of one horizontal and two vertical lines.  The vertical lines must not be in the same or neighboring columns.  The vertical lines must start in the same row and end in the same row (and thus have the same length).  The horizontal line should connect the vertical lines, but must not cross them.  The horizontal line can be in any row between the vertical lines (not only in the middle), except the top and the bottom one. (With the horizontal line in the top row the letter looks like 'n', and in the bottom row like 'U'.)  It is forbidden to build walls in cells of bad quality.  You can use at most one square of medium quality.  You can use any number of squares of perfect quality. Find the maximum number of walls that can be used to draw the letter 'H'.Check the note for more clarification.
