You are given two strings s and t. The string s consists of lowercase Latin letters and at most one wildcard character '*', the string t consists only of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string s equals n, the length of the string t equals m.The wildcard character '*' in the string s (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase Latin letters. No other character of s can be replaced with anything. If it is possible to replace a wildcard character '*' in s to obtain a string t, then the string t matches the pattern s.For example, if s="aba*aba" then the following strings match it "abaaba", "abacaba" and "abazzzaba", but the following strings do not match: "ababa", "abcaaba", "codeforces", "aba1aba", "aba?aba".If the given string t matches the given string s, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".
