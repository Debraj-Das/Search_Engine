Vasya writes his own library for building graphical user interface Vasya called his creation VTK VasyaToolKit One of the interesting aspects of this library is that widgets are packed in each other A widget is some element of graphical interface Each widget has width and height and occupies some rectangle on the screen Any widget in Vasyas library is of type Widget For simplicity we will identify the widget and its type Types HBox and VBox are derivatives of type Widget so they also are types Widget Widgets HBox and VBox are special They can store other widgets Both those widgets can use the pack method to pack directly in itself some other widget Widgets of types HBox and VBox can store several other widgets even several equal widgets  they will simply appear several times As a result of using the method pack only the link to the packed widget is saved that is when the packed widget is changed its image in the widget into which it is packed will also change We shall assume that the widget a is packed in the widget b if there exists a chain of widgets ac1c2ckb k2 for which ci is packed directly to ci1 for any 1ik In Vasyas library the situation when the widget a is packed in the widget a that is in itself is not allowed If you try to pack the widgets into each other in this manner immediately results in an errorAlso the widgets HBox and VBox have parameters border and spacing which are determined by the methods setborder and setspacing respectively By default both of these options equal 0    The picture above shows how the widgets are packed into HBox and VBox At that HBox and VBox automatically change their size depending on the size of packed widgets As for HBox and VBox they only differ in that in HBox the widgets are packed horizontally and in VBox  vertically The parameter spacing sets the distance between adjacent widgets and border  a frame around all packed widgets of the desired width Packed widgets are placed exactly in the order in which the pack method was called for them If within HBox or VBox there are no packed widgets their sizes are equal to 00 regardless of the options border and spacing The construction of all the widgets is performed using a scripting language VasyaScript The description of the language can be found in the input data For the final verification of the code Vasya asks you to write a program that calculates the sizes of all the widgets on the source code in the language of VasyaScript
