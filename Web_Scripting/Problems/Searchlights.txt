There are n robbers at coordinates (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n) and m searchlight at coordinates (c_1, d_1), (c_2, d_2), ..., (c_m, d_m). In one move you can move each robber to the right (increase a_i of each robber by one) or move each robber up (increase b_i of each robber by one). Note that you should either increase all a_i or all b_i, you can't increase a_i for some points and b_i for some other points.Searchlight j can see a robber i if a_i \leq c_j and b_i \leq d_j. A configuration of robbers is safe if no searchlight can see a robber (i.e. if there is no pair i,j such that searchlight j can see a robber i).What is the minimum number of moves you need to perform to reach a safe configuration?
