There are n participants in a competition, participant i having a strength of s_i. Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they have over the other best participant. In other words, each participant i wants to know the difference between s_i and s_j, where j is the strongest participant in the competition, not counting i (a difference can be negative).So, they ask you for your help! For each i (1 \leq i \leq n) output the difference between s_i and the maximum strength of any participant other than participant i.
