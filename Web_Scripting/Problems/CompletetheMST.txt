As a teacher, Riko Hakozaki often needs to help her students with problems from various subjects. Today, she is asked a programming task which goes as follows.You are given an undirected complete graph with n nodes, where some edges are pre-assigned with a positive weight while the rest aren't. You need to assign all unassigned edges with non-negative weights so that in the resulting fully-assigned complete graph the XOR sum of all weights would be equal to 0.Define the ugliness of a fully-assigned complete graph the weight of its minimum spanning tree, where the weight of a spanning tree equals the sum of weights of its edges. You need to assign the weights so that the ugliness of the resulting graph is as small as possible.As a reminder, an undirected complete graph with n nodes contains all edges (u, v) with 1 \le u < v \le n; such a graph has \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.She is not sure how to solve this problem, so she asks you to solve it for her.
