You are given an array a consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n.Your problem is to find such pair of indices i, j (1 \le i < j \le n) that lcm(a_i, a_j) is minimum possible.lcm(x, y) is the least common multiple of x and y (minimum positive number such that both x and y are divisors of this number).
