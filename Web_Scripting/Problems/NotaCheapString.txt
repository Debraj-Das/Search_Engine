Let s be a string of lowercase Latin letters. Its price is the sum of the indices of letters (an integer between 1 and 26) that are included in it. For example, the price of the string abca is 1+2+3+1=7.The string w and the integer p are given. Remove the minimal number of letters from w so that its price becomes less than or equal to p and print the resulting string. Note that the resulting string may be empty. You can delete arbitrary letters, they do not have to go in a row. If the price of a given string w is less than or equal to p, then nothing needs to be deleted and w must be output.Note that when you delete a letter from w, the order of the remaining letters is preserved. For example, if you delete the letter e from the string test, you get tst.
