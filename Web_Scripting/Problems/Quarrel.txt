Friends Alex and Bob live in Bertown. In this town there are n crossroads, some of them are connected by bidirectional roads of equal length. Bob lives in a house at the crossroads number 1, Alex — in a house at the crossroads number n.One day Alex and Bob had a big quarrel, and they refused to see each other. It occurred that today Bob needs to get from his house to the crossroads n and Alex needs to get from his house to the crossroads 1. And they don't want to meet at any of the crossroads, but they can meet in the middle of the street, when passing it in opposite directions. Alex and Bob asked you, as their mutual friend, to help them with this difficult task.Find for Alex and Bob such routes with equal number of streets that the guys can follow these routes and never appear at the same crossroads at the same time. They are allowed to meet in the middle of the street when moving toward each other (see Sample 1). Among all possible routes, select such that the number of streets in it is the least possible. Until both guys reach their destinations, none of them can stay without moving. The guys are moving simultaneously with equal speeds, i.e. it is possible that when one of them reaches some of the crossroads, the other one leaves it. For example, Alex can move from crossroad 1 to crossroad 2, while Bob moves from crossroad 2 to crossroad 3.If the required routes don't exist, your program should output -1.
