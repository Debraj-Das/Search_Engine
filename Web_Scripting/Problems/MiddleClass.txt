Many years ago Berland was a small country where only n people lived. Each person had some savings: the i-th one had a_i burles.The government considered a person as wealthy if he had at least x burles. To increase the number of wealthy people Berland decided to carry out several reforms. Each reform looked like that:   the government chooses some subset of people (maybe all of them);  the government takes all savings from the chosen people and redistributes the savings among the chosen people equally. For example, consider the savings as list [5, 1, 2, 1]: if the government chose the 1-st and the 3-rd persons then it, at first, will take all 5 + 2 = 7 burles and after that will return 3.5 burles to the chosen people. As a result, the savings will become [3.5, 1, 3.5, 1].A lot of data was lost from that time, so we don't know how many reforms were implemented and to whom. All we can do is ask you to calculate the maximum possible number of wealthy people after several (maybe zero) reforms.
