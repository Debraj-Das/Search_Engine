Alicia has an array, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, of non-negative integers. For each 1 \leq i \leq n, she has found a non-negative integer x_i = max(0, a_1, \ldots, a_{i-1}). Note that for i=1, x_i = 0.For example, if Alicia had the array a = \{0, 1, 2, 0, 3\}, then x = \{0, 0, 1, 2, 2\}.Then, she calculated an array, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n: b_i = a_i - x_i.For example, if Alicia had the array a = \{0, 1, 2, 0, 3\}, b = \{0-0, 1-0, 2-1, 0-2, 3-2\} = \{0, 1, 1, -2, 1\}.Alicia gives you the values b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n and asks you to restore the values a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Can you help her solve the problem?
