You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. You can perform the following operation any number of times:  Choose a pair of two neighboring equal elements a_i = a_{i + 1} (if there is at least one such pair).  Replace them by one element with value a_i + 1. After each such operation, the length of the array will decrease by one (and elements are renumerated accordingly). What is the minimum possible length of the array a you can get?
