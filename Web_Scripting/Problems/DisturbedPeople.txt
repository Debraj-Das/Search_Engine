There is a house with n flats situated on the main street of Berlatov. Vova is watching this house every night. The house can be represented as an array of n integer numbers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, where a_i = 1 if in the i-th flat the light is on and a_i = 0 otherwise.Vova thinks that people in the i-th flats are disturbed and cannot sleep if and only if 1 < i < n and a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} = 1 and a_i = 0.Vova is concerned by the following question: what is the minimum number k such that if people from exactly k pairwise distinct flats will turn off the lights then nobody will be disturbed? Your task is to find this number k.
