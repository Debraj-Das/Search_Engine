A fashion tour consists of m identical runway shows in different cities. There are n models willing to participate in the tour, numbered from 1 to n. People in different cities have different views on the fashion industry, so they rate each model differently. In particular, people in city i rate model j with rating r_{i, j}.You are to choose some number of k models, and their order, let the chosen models have indices j_1, j_2, \dots, j_k in the chosen order. In each city, these k models will walk the runway one after another in this order. To make the show exciting, in each city, the ratings of models should be strictly increasing in the order of their performance. More formally, for any city i and index t (2 \leq t \leq k), the ratings must satisfy r_{i,j_{t - 1}} < r_{i,j_t}. After all, the fashion industry is all about money, so choosing model j to participate in the tour profits you p_j money. Compute the maximum total profit you can make by choosing the models and their order while satisfying all the requirements.
