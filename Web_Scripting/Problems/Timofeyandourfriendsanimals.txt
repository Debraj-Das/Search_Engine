After his birthday party Timofey went to his favorite tree alley in a park He wants to feed there his favorite birds crowsIts widely known that each tree is occupied by a single crow family The trees in the alley form a row and are numbered from 1 to n Some families are friends to each other For some reasons two families can be friends only if they live not too far from each other more precisely there is no more than k1 trees between any pair of friend families Formally the family on the uth tree and the family on the vth tree can be friends only if uvk holdsOne of the friendship features is that if some family learns that Timofey is feeding crows somewhere it notifies about this all friend families Thus after Timofey starts to feed crows under some tree all the families that are friends to the family living on this tree as well as their friends and so on fly to the feeding place Of course the family living on the tree also comes to the feeding placeToday Timofey came to the alley and noticed that all the families that live on trees with numbers strictly less than l or strictly greater than r have flown away Thus it is not possible to pass the information about feeding through them Moreover there is no need to feed them Help Timofey to learn what is the minimum number of trees under which he has to feed crows so that all the families that have remained will get the information about feeding You are given several situations described by integers l and r you need to calculate the answer for all of them
