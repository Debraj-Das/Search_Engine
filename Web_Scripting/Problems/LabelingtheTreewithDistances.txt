You are given an unweighted tree of n vertices numbered from 1 to n and a list of n-1 integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}. A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. You will use each element of the list to label one vertex. No vertex should be labeled twice. You can label the only remaining unlabeled vertex with any integer. A vertex x is called good if it is possible to do this labeling so that for each vertex i, its label is the distance between x and i. The distance between two vertices s and t on a tree is the minimum number of edges on a path that starts at vertex s and ends at vertex t. Find all good vertices.
