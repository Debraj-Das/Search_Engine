You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and a number k. Let's call a string consisting of lowercase English letters beautiful if the number of occurrences of each letter in that string is divisible by k. You are asked to find the lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length n, which is lexicographically greater or equal to string s. If such a string does not exist, output -1.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:   a is a prefix of b, but a \ne b;  in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
