On a strip of land of length n there are k air conditioners: the i-th air conditioner is placed in cell a_i (1 \le a_i \le n). Two or more air conditioners cannot be placed in the same cell (i.e. all a_i are distinct).Each air conditioner is characterized by one parameter: temperature. The i-th air conditioner is set to the temperature t_i.  Example of strip of length n=6, where k=2, a=[2,5] and t=[14,16]. For each cell i (1 \le i \le n) find it's temperature, that can be calculated by the formula \min_{1 \le j \le k}(t_j + |a_j - i|),where |a_j - i| denotes absolute value of the difference a_j - i.In other words, the temperature in cell i is equal to the minimum among the temperatures of air conditioners, increased by the distance from it to the cell i.Let's look at an example. Consider that n=6, k=2, the first air conditioner is placed in cell a_1=2 and is set to the temperature t_1=14 and the second air conditioner is placed in cell a_2=5 and is set to the temperature t_2=16. In that case temperatures in cells are:  temperature in cell 1 is: \min(14 + |2 - 1|, 16 + |5 - 1|)=\min(14 + 1, 16 + 4)=\min(15, 20)=15;  temperature in cell 2 is: \min(14 + |2 - 2|, 16 + |5 - 2|)=\min(14 + 0, 16 + 3)=\min(14, 19)=14;  temperature in cell 3 is: \min(14 + |2 - 3|, 16 + |5 - 3|)=\min(14 + 1, 16 + 2)=\min(15, 18)=15;  temperature in cell 4 is: \min(14 + |2 - 4|, 16 + |5 - 4|)=\min(14 + 2, 16 + 1)=\min(16, 17)=16;  temperature in cell 5 is: \min(14 + |2 - 5|, 16 + |5 - 5|)=\min(14 + 3, 16 + 0)=\min(17, 16)=16;  temperature in cell 6 is: \min(14 + |2 - 6|, 16 + |5 - 6|)=\min(14 + 4, 16 + 1)=\min(18, 17)=17. For each cell from 1 to n find the temperature in it.
