Kristina has two arrays a and b, each containing n non-negative integers. She can perform the following operation on array a any number of times:   apply a decrement to each non-zero element of the array, that is, replace the value of each element a_i such that a_i > 0 with the value a_i - 1 (1 \le i \le n). If a_i was 0, its value does not change. Determine whether Kristina can get an array b from an array a in some number of operations (probably zero). In other words, can she make a_i = b_i after some number of operations for each 1 \le i \le n?For example, let n = 4, a = [3, 5, 4, 1] and b = [1, 3, 2, 0]. In this case, she can apply the operation twice:   after the first application of the operation she gets a = [2, 4, 3, 0];  after the second use of the operation she gets a = [1, 3, 2, 0]. Thus, in two operations, she can get an array b from an array a.
