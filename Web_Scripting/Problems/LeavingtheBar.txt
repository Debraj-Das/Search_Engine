For a vector \vec{v} = (x, y), define |v| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.Allen had a bit too much to drink at the bar, which is at the origin. There are n vectors \vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}, \cdots, \vec{v_n}. Allen will make n moves. As Allen's sense of direction is impaired, during the i-th move he will either move in the direction \vec{v_i} or -\vec{v_i}. In other words, if his position is currently p = (x, y), he will either move to p + \vec{v_i} or p - \vec{v_i}.Allen doesn't want to wander too far from home (which happens to also be the bar). You need to help him figure out a sequence of moves (a sequence of signs for the vectors) such that his final position p satisfies |p| \le 1.5 \cdot 10^6 so that he can stay safe.
