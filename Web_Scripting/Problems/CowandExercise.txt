Farmer John is obsessed with making Bessie exercise more!Bessie is out grazing on the farm, which consists of n fields connected by m directed roads. Each road takes some time w_i to cross. She is currently at field 1 and will return to her home at field n at the end of the day.Farmer John has plans to increase the time it takes to cross certain roads. He can increase the time it takes to cross each road by a nonnegative amount, but the total increase cannot exceed x_i for the i-th plan. Determine the maximum he can make the shortest path from 1 to n for each of the q independent plans.
