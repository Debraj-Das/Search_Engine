You are given two integers l and r, where l < r. We will add 1 to l until the result is equal to r. Thus, there will be exactly r-l additions performed. For each such addition, let's look at the number of digits that will be changed after it.For example:   if l=909, then adding one will result in 910 and 2 digits will be changed;  if you add one to l=9, the result will be 10 and 2 digits will also be changed;  if you add one to l=489999, the result will be 490000 and 5 digits will be changed. Changed digits always form a suffix of the result written in the decimal system.Output the total number of changed digits, if you want to get r from l, adding 1 each time.
