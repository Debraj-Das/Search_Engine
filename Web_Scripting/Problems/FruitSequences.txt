Zookeeper is buying a carton of fruit to feed his pet wabbit. The fruits are a sequence of apples and oranges, which is represented by a binary string s_1s_2\ldots s_n of length n. 1 represents an apple and 0 represents an orange.Since wabbit is allergic to eating oranges, Zookeeper would like to find the longest contiguous sequence of apples. Let f(l,r) be the longest contiguous sequence of apples in the substring s_{l}s_{l+1}\ldots s_{r}. Help Zookeeper find \sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r), or the sum of f across all substrings.
