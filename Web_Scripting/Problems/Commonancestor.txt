The DNA sequence for every living creature in Berland can be represented as a non-empty line consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Berland scientists found out that all the creatures evolve by stages. During one stage exactly one symbol of the DNA line is replaced by exactly two other ones. At that overall there are n permissible substitutions. The substitution ai->bici means that any one symbol ai can be replaced with two symbols bici. Every substitution could happen an unlimited number of times.They say that two creatures with DNA sequences s1 and s2 can have a common ancestor if there exists such a DNA sequence s3 that throughout evolution it can result in s1 and s2, perhaps after a different number of stages. Your task is to find out by the given s1 and s2 whether the creatures possessing such DNA sequences can have a common ancestor. If the answer is positive, you have to find the length of the shortest sequence of the common ancestor’s DNA.
