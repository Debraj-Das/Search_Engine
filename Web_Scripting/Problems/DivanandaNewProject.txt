The company "Divan's Sofas" is planning to build n + 1 different buildings on a coordinate line so that:   the coordinate of each building is an integer number;  no two buildings stand at the same point. Let x_i be the coordinate of the i-th building. To get from the building i to the building j, Divan spends |x_i - x_j| minutes, where |y| is the absolute value of y.All buildings that Divan is going to build can be numbered from 0 to n. The businessman will live in the building 0, the new headquarters of "Divan's Sofas". In the first ten years after construction Divan will visit the i-th building a_i times, each time spending 2 \cdot |x_0-x_i| minutes for walking.Divan asks you to choose the coordinates for all n + 1 buildings so that over the next ten years the businessman will spend as little time for walking as possible.
