As you know an undirected connected graph with n nodes and n1 edges is called a tree You are given an integer d and a tree consisting of n nodes Each node i has a value ai associated with itWe call a set S of tree nodes valid if following conditions are satisfied S is nonempty S is connected In other words if nodes u and v are in S then all nodes lying on the simple path between u and v should also be presented in S Your task is to count the number of valid sets Since the result can be very large you must print its remainder modulo 1000000007 1097
