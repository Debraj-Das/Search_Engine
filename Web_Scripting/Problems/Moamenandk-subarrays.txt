Moamen has an array of n distinct integers. He wants to sort that array in non-decreasing order by doing the following operations in order exactly once:  Split the array into exactly k non-empty subarrays such that each element belongs to exactly one subarray.  Reorder these subarrays arbitrary.  Merge the subarrays in their new order. A sequence a is a subarray of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.Can you tell Moamen if there is a way to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the operations written above?
