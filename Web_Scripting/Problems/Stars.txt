Furik loves painting stars. A star is a shape that results if we take a regular pentagon and paint all diagonals in it.   Recently he decided to teach Rubik to paint stars. After many years of training Rubik could paint stars easily. But now Furik decided to test Rubik and complicated the task. Rubik must paint n stars, observing the following rules:  all stars must be painted in a single move (i.e. it is forbidden to take the pen away from the paper);  it is forbidden to paint the same segment of non-zero length more than once;  the stars can intersect only in their vertexes;  the length of a side of the regular pentagon, in which Rubik paints each star, must equal 10. Help Rubik to cope with this hard task.
