Vitya is studying in the third grade During the last math lesson all the pupils wrote on arithmetic quiz Vitya is a clever boy so he managed to finish all the tasks pretty fast and Oksana Fillipovna gave him a new one that is much harderLets denote a flip operation of an integer as follows number is considered in decimal notation and then reverted If there are any leading zeroes afterwards they are thrown away For example if we flip 123 the result is the integer 321 but flipping 130 we obtain 31 and by flipping 31 we come to 13Oksana Fillipovna picked some number a without leading zeroes and flipped it to get number ar Then she summed a and ar and told Vitya the resulting value n His goal is to find any valid aAs Oksana Fillipovna picked some small integers as a and ar Vitya managed to find the answer pretty fast and became interested in finding some general algorithm to deal with this problem Now he wants you to write the program that for given n finds any a without leading zeroes such that aarn or determine that such a doesnt exist
