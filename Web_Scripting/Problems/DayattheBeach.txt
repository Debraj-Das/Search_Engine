One day Squidward Spongebob and Patrick decided to go to the beach Unfortunately the weather was bad so the friends were unable to ride waves However they decided to spent their time building sand castlesAt the end of the day there were n castles built by friends Castles are numbered from 1 to n and the height of the ith castle is equal to hi When friends were about to leave Squidward noticed that castles are not ordered by their height and this looks ugly Now friends are going to reorder the castles in a way to obtain that condition hihi1 holds for all i from 1 to n1Squidward suggested the following process of sorting castles   Castles are split into blocks groups of consecutive castles Therefore the block from i to j will include castles ii1j A block may consist of a single castle  The partitioning is chosen in such a way that every castle is a part of exactly one block  Each block is sorted independently from other blocks that is the sequence hihi1hj becomes sorted  The partitioning should satisfy the condition that after each block is sorted the sequence hi becomes sorted too This may always be achieved by saying that the whole sequence is a single block Even Patrick understands that increasing the number of blocks in partitioning will ease the sorting process Now friends ask you to count the maximum possible number of blocks in a partitioning that satisfies all the above requirements
