Let's define the following recurrence: a_{n+1} = a_{n} + minDigit(a_{n}) \cdot maxDigit(a_{n}).Here minDigit(x) and maxDigit(x) are the minimal and maximal digits in the decimal representation of x without leading zeroes. For examples refer to notes.Your task is calculate a_{K} for given a_{1} and K.
