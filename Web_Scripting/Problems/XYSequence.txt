You are given four integers n, B, x and y. You should build a sequence a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where a_0 = 0 and for each i \ge 1 you can choose:   either a_i = a_{i - 1} + x  or a_i = a_{i - 1} - y. Your goal is to build such a sequence a that a_i \le B for all i and \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}{a_i} is maximum possible.
