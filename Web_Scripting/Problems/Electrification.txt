At first, there was a legend related to the name of the problem, but now it's just a formal statement.You are given n points a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n on the OX axis. Now you are asked to find such an integer point x on OX axis that f_k(x) is minimal possible.The function f_k(x) can be described in the following way:   form a list of distances d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n where d_i = |a_i - x| (distance between a_i and x);  sort list d in non-descending order;  take d_{k + 1} as a result. If there are multiple optimal answers you can print any of them.
