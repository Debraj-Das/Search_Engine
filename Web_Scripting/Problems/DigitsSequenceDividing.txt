You are given a sequence s consisting of n digits from 1 to 9.You have to divide it into at least two segments (segment — is a consecutive sequence of elements) (in other words, you have to place separators between some digits of the sequence) in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one segment and if the resulting division will be represented as an integer numbers sequence then each next element of this sequence will be strictly greater than the previous one.More formally: if the resulting division of the sequence is t_1, t_2, \dots, t_k, where k is the number of element in a division, then for each i from 1 to k-1 the condition t_{i} < t_{i + 1} (using numerical comparing, it means that the integer representations of strings are compared) should be satisfied.For example, if s=654 then you can divide it into parts [6, 54] and it will be suitable division. But if you will divide it into parts [65, 4] then it will be bad division because 65 > 4. If s=123 then you can divide it into parts [1, 23], [1, 2, 3] but not into parts [12, 3].Your task is to find any suitable division for each of the q independent queries.
