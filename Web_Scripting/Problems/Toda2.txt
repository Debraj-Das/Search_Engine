A group of n friends enjoys playing popular video game Toda 2 There is a rating system describing skill level of each player initially the rating of the ith friend is riThe friends decided to take part in the championship as a team But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all n friends So the friends are faced with the problem how to make all their ratings equalOne way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches Friends can form a party consisting of two to five but not more than n friends and play a match in the game When the party loses the rating of each of its members decreases by 1 A rating cant become negative so ri0 doesnt change after losingThe friends can take part in multiple matches each time making a party from any subset of friends but remember about constraints on party size from 2 to 5 membersThe friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possibleHelp the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible
