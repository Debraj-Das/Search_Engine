Once upon a time Algoland and Berland were a single country, but those times are long gone. Now they are two different countries, but their cities are scattered on a common territory.All cities are represented as points on the Cartesian plane. Algoland consists of a cities numbered from 1 to a. The coordinates of the i-th Algoland city are a pair of integer numbers (xa_i, ya_i). Similarly, Berland consists of b cities numbered from 1 to b. The coordinates of the j-th Berland city are a pair of integer numbers (xb_j, yb_j). No three of the a+b mentioned cities lie on a single straight line.As the first step to unite the countries, Berland decided to build several bidirectional freeways. Each freeway is going to be a line segment that starts in a Berland city and ends in an Algoland city. Freeways can't intersect with each other at any point except freeway's start or end. Moreover, the freeways have to connect all a+b cities. Here, connectivity means that one can get from any of the specified a+b cities to any other of the a+b cities using freeways. Note that all freeways are bidirectional, which means that one can drive on each of them in both directions.Mayor of each of the b Berland cities allocated a budget to build the freeways that start from this city. Thus, you are given the numbers r_1, r_2, \dots, r_b, where r_j is the number of freeways that are going to start in the j-th Berland city. The total allocated budget is very tight and only covers building the minimal necessary set of freeways. In other words, r_1+r_2+\dots+r_b=a+b-1.Help Berland to build the freeways so that:  each freeway is a line segment connecting a Berland city and an Algoland city,  no freeways intersect with each other except for the freeway's start or end,  freeways connect all a+b cities (all freeways are bidirectional),  there are r_j freeways that start from the j-th Berland city.
