You have a list of numbers from 1 to n written from left to right on the blackboard.You perform an algorithm consisting of several steps (steps are 1-indexed). On the i-th step you wipe the i-th number (considering only remaining numbers). You wipe the whole number (not one digit).  When there are less than i numbers remaining, you stop your algorithm. Now you wonder: what is the value of the x-th remaining number after the algorithm is stopped?
