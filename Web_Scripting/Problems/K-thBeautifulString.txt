For the given integer n (n > 2) let's write down all the strings of length n which contain n-2 letters 'a' and two letters 'b' in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.Recall that the string s of length n is lexicographically less than string t of length n, if there exists such i (1 \le i \le n), that s_i < t_i, and for any j (1 \le j < i) s_j = t_j. The lexicographic comparison of strings is implemented by the operator < in modern programming languages.For example, if n=5 the strings are (the order does matter):  aaabb  aabab  aabba  abaab  ababa  abbaa  baaab  baaba  babaa  bbaaa It is easy to show that such a list of strings will contain exactly \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2} strings.You are given n (n > 2) and k (1 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2}). Print the k-th string from the list.
