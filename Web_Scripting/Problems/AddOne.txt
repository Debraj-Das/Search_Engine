You are given an integer n. You have to apply m operations to it.In a single operation, you must replace every digit d of the number with the decimal representation of integer d + 1. For example, 1912 becomes 21023 after applying the operation once.You have to find the length of n after applying m operations. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 10^9+7.
