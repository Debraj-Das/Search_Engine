Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.Petya has two strings a and b of the same length n. The strings consist only of lucky digits. Petya can perform operations of two types:   replace any one digit from string a by its opposite (i.e., replace 4 by 7 and 7 by 4);  swap any pair of digits in string a. Petya is interested in the minimum number of operations that are needed to make string a equal to string b. Help him with the task.
