YouKn0wWho has an integer sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. He will perform the following operation until the sequence becomes empty: select an index i such that 1 \le i \le |a| and a_i is not divisible by (i + 1), and erase this element from the sequence. Here |a| is the length of sequence a at the moment of operation. Note that the sequence a changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.For example, if a=[3,5,4,5], then he can select i = 2, because a_2 = 5 is not divisible by i+1 = 3. After this operation the sequence is [3,4,5].Help YouKn0wWho determine if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation.
