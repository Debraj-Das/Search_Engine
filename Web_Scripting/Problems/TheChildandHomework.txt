Once upon a time a child got a test consisting of multiple-choice questions as homework. A multiple-choice question consists of four choices: A, B, C and D. Each choice has a description, and the child should find out the only one that is correct.Fortunately the child knows how to solve such complicated test. The child will follow the algorithm:  If there is some choice whose description at least twice shorter than all other descriptions, or at least twice longer than all other descriptions, then the child thinks the choice is great.  If there is exactly one great choice then the child chooses it. Otherwise the child chooses C (the child think it is the luckiest choice). You are given a multiple-choice questions, can you predict child's choose?
