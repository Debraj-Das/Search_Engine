There are n players, numbered from 1 to n sitting around a round table. The (i+1)-th player sits to the right of the i-th player for 1 \le i < n, and the 1-st player sits to the right of the n-th player.There are n^2 cards, each of which has an integer between 1 and n written on it. For each integer from 1 to n, there are exactly n cards having this number.Initially, all these cards are distributed among all the players, in such a way that each of them has exactly n cards. In one operation, each player chooses one of his cards and passes it to the player to his right. All these actions are performed simultaneously. Player i is called solid if all his cards have the integer i written on them. Their objective is to reach a configuration in which everyone is solid. Find a way to do it using at most (n^2-n) operations. You do not need to minimize the number of operations.
