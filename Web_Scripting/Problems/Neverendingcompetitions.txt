There are literally dozens of snooker competitions held each year, and team Jinotega tries to attend them all (for some reason they prefer name "snookah")! When a competition takes place somewhere far from their hometown, Ivan, Artsem and Konstantin take a flight to the contest and back.Jinotega's best friends, team Base have found a list of their itinerary receipts with information about departure and arrival airports. Now they wonder, where is Jinotega now: at home or at some competition far away? They know that:   this list contains all Jinotega's flights in this year (in arbitrary order),  Jinotega has only flown from his hometown to a snooker contest and back,  after each competition Jinotega flies back home (though they may attend a competition in one place several times),  and finally, at the beginning of the year Jinotega was at home. Please help them to determine Jinotega's location!
