Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a grid a of size n \times mEach cell (x,y) contains an integer a_{x,y} denoting the direction of how the ball will move.  a_{x,y}=1 — the ball will move to the right (the next cell is (x, y + 1));  a_{x,y}=2 — the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is (x + 1, y));  a_{x,y}=3 — the ball will move to the left (the next cell is (x, y - 1)). Every time a ball leaves a cell (x,y), the integer a_{x,y} will change to 2. Mr. Chanek will drop k balls sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k-th (1 \leq c_i \leq m) columns.Determine in which column each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).
