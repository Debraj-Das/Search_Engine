Jeff got 2n real numbers a1a2a2n as a birthday present The boy hates noninteger numbers so he decided to slightly adjust the numbers hes got Namely Jeff consecutively executes n operations each of them goes as follows  choose indexes i and j ij that havent been chosen yet  round element ai to the nearest integer that isnt more than ai assign to ai  ai  round element aj to the nearest integer that isnt less than aj assign to aj  aj Nevertheless Jeff doesnt want to hurt the feelings of the person who gave him the sequence Thats why the boy wants to perform the operations so as to make the absolute value of the difference between the sum of elements before performing the operations and the sum of elements after performing the operations as small as possible Help Jeff find the minimum absolute value of the difference
