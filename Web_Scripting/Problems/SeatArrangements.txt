Suppose that you are in a campus and have to go for classes day by day. As you may see, when you hurry to a classroom, you surprisingly find that many seats there are already occupied. Today you and your friends went for class, and found out that some of the seats were occupied.The classroom contains n rows of seats and there are m seats in each row. Then the classroom can be represented as an n \times m matrix. The character '.' represents an empty seat, while '*' means that the seat is occupied. You need to find k consecutive empty seats in the same row or column and arrange those seats for you and your friends. Your task is to find the number of ways to arrange the seats.
