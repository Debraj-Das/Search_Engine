Everybody knows of spaghetti sort You decided to implement an analog sorting algorithm yourself but as you survey your pantry you realize youre out of spaghetti The only type of pasta you have is ravioli but you are not going to let this stop youYou come up with the following algorithm For each number in the array ai build a stack of ai ravioli The image shows the stack for ai4  Arrange the stacks in one row in the order in which the corresponding numbers appear in the input array Find the tallest one if there are several stacks of maximal height use the leftmost one Remove it and add its height to the end of the output array Shift the stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them Repeat the procedure until all stacks have been removedAt first you are very happy with your algorithm but as you try it on more inputs you realize that it doesnt always produce the right sorted array Turns out when two stacks of ravioli are next to each other at any step of the process and differ in height by two or more the top ravioli of the taller stack slides down on top of the lower stackGiven an input array figure out whether the described algorithm will sort it correctly
