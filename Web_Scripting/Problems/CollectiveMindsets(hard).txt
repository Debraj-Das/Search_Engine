Heidi got one brain thumbs up But the evening isnt over yet and one more challenge awaits our dauntless agent after dinner at precisely midnight the N attendees love to play a very risky gameEvery zombie gets a number ni 1niN written on his forehead Although no zombie can see his own number he can see the numbers written on the foreheads of all N1 fellows Note that not all numbers have to be unique they can even all be the same From this point on no more communication between zombies is allowed Observation is the only key to success When the cuckoo clock strikes midnight all attendees have to simultaneously guess the number on their own forehead If at least one of them guesses his number correctly all zombies survive and go home happily On the other hand if not a single attendee manages to guess his number correctly all of them are doomed to dieZombies arent very bright creatures though and Heidi has to act fast if she does not want to jeopardize her life She has one single option by performing some quick surgery on the brain she managed to get from the chest she has the ability to remotely reprogram the decisionmaking strategy of all attendees for their upcoming midnight game Can you suggest a sound strategy to Heidi which given the rules of the game ensures that at least one attendee will guess his own number correctly for any possible sequence of numbers on the foreheadsGiven a zombies rank R and the N1 numbers ni on the other attendees foreheads your program will have to return the number that the zombie of rank R shall guess Those answers define your strategy and we will check if it is flawless or not
