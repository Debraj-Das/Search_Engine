The city has n buses and m trolleys, the buses are numbered by integers from 1 to n, the trolleys are numbered by integers from 1 to m.Public transport is not free. There are 4 types of tickets:   A ticket for one ride on some bus or trolley. It costs c1 burles;  A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on some bus or on some trolley. It costs c2 burles;  A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on all buses or all trolleys. It costs c3 burles;  A ticket for an unlimited number of rides on all buses and trolleys.
