During a daily walk Alina noticed a long number written on the ground. Now Alina wants to find some positive number of same length without leading zeroes, such that the sum of these two numbers is a palindrome. Recall that a number is called a palindrome, if it reads the same right to left and left to right. For example, numbers 121, 66, 98989 are palindromes, and 103, 239, 1241 are not palindromes.Alina understands that a valid number always exist. Help her find one!
