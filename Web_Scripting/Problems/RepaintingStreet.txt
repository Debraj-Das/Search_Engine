There is a street with n houses in a line, numbered from 1 to n. The house i is initially painted in color c_i. The street is considered beautiful if all houses are painted in the same color. Tom, the painter, is in charge of making the street beautiful. Tom's painting capacity is defined by an integer, let's call it k.On one day, Tom can do the following repainting process that consists of two steps:   He chooses two integers l and r such that  1 \le l \le r \le n  and  r - l + 1 = k .  For each house i such that l \le i \le r, he can either repaint it with any color he wants, or ignore it and let it keep its current color. Note that in the same day Tom can use different colors to repaint different houses.Tom wants to know the minimum number of days needed to repaint the street so that it becomes beautiful.
