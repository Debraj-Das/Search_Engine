A star map in Berland is a checked field nm squares In each square there is or there is not a star The favourite constellation of all Berlands astronomers is the constellation of the Cross This constellation can be formed by any 5 stars so that for some integer x radius of the constellation the following is true   the 2nd is on the same vertical line as the 1st but x squares up  the 3rd is on the same vertical line as the 1st but x squares down  the 4th is on the same horizontal line as the 1st but x squares left  the 5th is on the same horizontal line as the 1st but x squares right Such constellations can be very numerous thats why they are numbered with integers from 1 on the following principle when two constellations are compared the one with a smaller radius gets a smaller index if their radii are equal  the one whose central star if higher than the central star of the other one if their central stars are at the same level  the one whose central star is to the left of the central star of the other oneYour task is to find the constellation with index k by the given Berlands star map
