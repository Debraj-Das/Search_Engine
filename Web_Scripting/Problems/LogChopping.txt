There are n logs, the i-th log has a length of a_i meters. Since chopping logs is tiring work, errorgorn and maomao90 have decided to play a game.errorgorn and maomao90 will take turns chopping the logs with errorgorn chopping first. On his turn, the player will pick a log and chop it into 2 pieces. If the length of the chosen log is x, and the lengths of the resulting pieces are y and z, then y and z have to be positive integers, and x=y+z must hold. For example, you can chop a log of length 3 into logs of lengths 2 and 1, but not into logs of lengths 3 and 0, 2 and 2, or 1.5 and 1.5.The player who is unable to make a chop will be the loser. Assuming that both errorgorn and maomao90 play optimally, who will be the winner?
