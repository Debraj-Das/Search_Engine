Phoenix has n blocks of height h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n, and all h_i don't exceed some value x. He plans to stack all n blocks into m separate towers. The height of a tower is simply the sum of the heights of its blocks. For the towers to look beautiful, no two towers may have a height difference of strictly more than x. Please help Phoenix build m towers that look beautiful. Each tower must have at least one block and all blocks must be used.
