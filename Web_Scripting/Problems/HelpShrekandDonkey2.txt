Having learned not without some help from the Codeforces participants to play the card game from the previous round optimally Shrek and Donkey as you may remember they too live now in the Kingdom of Far Far Away have decided to quit the boring card games and play with toy soldiersThe rules of the game are as follows there is a battlefield its size equals nm squares some squares contain the toy soldiers the green ones belong to Shrek and the red ones belong to Donkey Besides each of the n lines of the area contains not more than two soldiers During a move a players should select not less than 1 and not more than k soldiers belonging to him and make them either attack or retreatAn attack is moving all of the selected soldiers along the lines on which they stand in the direction of an enemy soldier if he is in this line If this line doesnt have an enemy soldier then the selected soldier on this line can move in any direction during the players move Each selected soldier has to move at least by one cell Different soldiers can move by a different number of cells During the attack the soldiers are not allowed to cross the cells where other soldiers stand or stood immediately before the attack It is also not allowed to go beyond the battlefield or finish the attack in the cells where other soldiers stand or stood immediately before attackA retreat is moving all of the selected soldiers along the lines on which they stand in the direction from an enemy soldier if he is in this line The other rules repeat the rules of the attackFor example lets suppose that the original battlefield had the form here symbols G mark Shreks green soldiers and symbols R mark Donkeys red ones  GRRG  Lets suppose that k2 and Shrek moves first If he decides to attack then after his move the battlefield can look like that  GR     GR     GRRG     RG     RG  If in the previous example Shrek decides to retreat then after his move the battlefield can look like that  GR     GR     GRRG     RG     RG  On the other hand the followings fields cannot result from Shreks correct move  GR     RG     GRRG     RG     GR  Shrek starts the game To make a move means to attack or to retreat by the rules A player who cannot make a move loses and his opponent is the winner Determine the winner of the given toy soldier game if Shrek and Donkey continue to be under the yellow pills from the last rounds problem Thus they always play optimally that is they try to win if it is possible or finish the game in a draw by ensuring that it lasts forever if they cannot win
