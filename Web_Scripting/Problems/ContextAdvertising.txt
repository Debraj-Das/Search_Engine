Advertising has become part of our routine And now in the era of progressive technologies we need your ideas to make advertising betterIn this problem well look at a simplified version of context advertising Youve got a text consisting of exactly n words A standard advertising banner has exactly r lines each line can contain at most c characters The potential customer always likes it when they can see lots of advertising so you should determine which maximum number of consecutive words from the text can be written on the banner Single words in one line of the banner should be separated by spaces You are allowed to insert more than one space at once Note that you are not allowed to break the words that is each word in the text must occupy exactly one line in the banner Besides you cannot change the word order that is if you read the banner text consecutively from top to bottom and from left to right you should get some consecutive part of the advertisement textMore formally the statement can be written like that Lets say that all words are indexed from 1 to n in the order in which they occur in the advertisement text Then you have to choose all words starting from some ith one and ending with some jth one 1ijn so that all of them could be written on the banner There must be as many words as possible See the samples for clarifications
