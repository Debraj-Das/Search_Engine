The sequence a is sent over the network as follows:  sequence a is split into segments (each element of the sequence belongs to exactly one segment, each segment is a group of consecutive elements of sequence);  for each segment, its length is written next to it, either to the left of it or to the right of it;  the resulting sequence b is sent over the network. For example, we needed to send the sequence a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]. Suppose it was split into segments as follows: [\color{red}{1}] + [\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}] + [\color{green}{2, 3}]. Then we could have the following sequences:   b = [1, \color{red}{1}, 3, \color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, \color{green}{2, 3}, 2],  b = [\color{red}{1}, 1, 3, \color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, 2, \color{green}{2, 3}],  b = [\color{red}{1}, 1, \color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, 3, 2, \color{green}{2, 3}],  b = [\color{red}{1}, 1,\color{blue}{2, 3, 1}, 3, \color{green}{2, 3}, 2]. If a different segmentation had been used, the sent sequence might have been different.The sequence b is given. Could the sequence b be sent over the network? In other words, is there such a sequence a that converting a to send it over the network could result in a sequence b?
