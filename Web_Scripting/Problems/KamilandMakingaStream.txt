Kamil likes streaming the competitive programming videos. His MeTube channel has recently reached 100 million subscribers. In order to celebrate this, he posted a video with an interesting problem he couldn't solve yet. Can you help him?You're given a tree — a connected undirected graph consisting of n vertices connected by n - 1 edges. The tree is rooted at vertex 1. A vertex u is called an ancestor of v if it lies on the shortest path between the root and v. In particular, a vertex is an ancestor of itself.Each vertex v is assigned its beauty x_v — a non-negative integer not larger than 10^{12}. This allows us to define the beauty of a path. Let u be an ancestor of v. Then we define the beauty f(u, v) as the greatest common divisor of the beauties of all vertices on the shortest path between u and v. Formally, if u=t_1, t_2, t_3, \dots, t_k=v are the vertices on the shortest path between u and v, then f(u, v) = \gcd(x_{t_1}, x_{t_2}, \dots, x_{t_k}). Here, \gcd denotes the greatest common divisor of a set of numbers. In particular, f(u, u) = \gcd(x_u) = x_u.Your task is to find the sum \sum_{u\text{ is an ancestor of }v} f(u, v). As the result might be too large, please output it modulo 10^9 + 7.Note that for each y, \gcd(0, y) = \gcd(y, 0) = y. In particular, \gcd(0, 0) = 0.
