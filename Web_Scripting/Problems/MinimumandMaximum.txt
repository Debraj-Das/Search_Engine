This is an interactive problem You have to use flush operation right after printing each line For example in C you should use function fflushstdout in Java  Systemoutflush in Pascal  flushoutput and in Python  sysstdoutflushIn this problem you need to find maximal and minimal elements of an array What could be simplerYou can imagine that the jury has an array and initially you know the only number n  arrays lengthArrays elements are numbered from 1 to n You are allowed to compare two elements of the array by using their indices i and j There are three possible responses to this query  if ai is less than aj  if ai is equal to aj and finally  if ai is greater than ajIts known that its always possible to find both maximal and minimal elements of the array by using no more than  comparisons where  x is the result of rounding x upWrite the program that will find positions of the minimum and the maximum in the jurys array of length n by using no more than fn comparisons
