Once Petya was in such a good mood that he decided to help his mum with the washing-up. There were n dirty bowls in the sink. From the geometrical point of view each bowl looks like a blunted cone. We can disregard the width of the walls and bottom. Petya puts the clean bowls one on another naturally, i. e. so that their vertical axes coincide (see the picture). You will be given the order in which Petya washes the bowls. Determine the height of the construction, i.e. the distance from the bottom of the lowest bowl to the top of the highest one.
