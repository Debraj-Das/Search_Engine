You have a given picture with size w \times h. Determine if the given picture has a single "+" shape or not. A "+" shape is described below:  A "+" shape has one center nonempty cell.  There should be some (at least one) consecutive non-empty cells in each direction (left, right, up, down) from the center. In other words, there should be a ray in each direction.  All other cells are empty. Find out if the given picture has single "+" shape.
