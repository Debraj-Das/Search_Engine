The only difference between easy and hard versions is the number of elements in the array.You are given an array a consisting of n integers. In one move you can choose any a_i and divide it by 2 rounding down (in other words, in one move you can set a_i := \lfloor\frac{a_i}{2}\rfloor).You can perform such an operation any (possibly, zero) number of times with any a_i.Your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of operations required to obtain at least k equal numbers in the array.Don't forget that it is possible to have a_i = 0 after some operations, thus the answer always exists.
