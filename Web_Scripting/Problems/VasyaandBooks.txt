Vasya has got n books, numbered from 1 to n, arranged in a stack. The topmost book has number a_1, the next one — a_2, and so on. The book at the bottom of the stack has number a_n. All numbers are distinct.Vasya wants to move all the books to his backpack in n steps. During i-th step he wants to move the book number b_i into his backpack. If the book with number b_i is in the stack, he takes this book and all the books above the book b_i, and puts them into the backpack; otherwise he does nothing and begins the next step. For example, if books are arranged in the order [1, 2, 3] (book 1 is the topmost), and Vasya moves the books in the order [2, 1, 3], then during the first step he will move two books (1 and 2), during the second step he will do nothing (since book 1 is already in the backpack), and during the third step — one book (the book number 3). Note that b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n are distinct.Help Vasya! Tell him the number of books he will put into his backpack during each step.
