Cactus lady loves her cactuses very much. Especially she likes a small cactus named Cing. Cing can be seen as a connected undirected graph in which every vertex lies on at most one simple cycle. Intuitively, a cactus is a generalization of a tree where some cycles are allowed. Multiedges (multiple edges between a pair of vertices) and loops (edges that connect a vertex to itself) are not allowed.She bought a special grid for her special little cactus Cing. This grid can be represented as a graph consisting of two paths of length 400\,000, u_{(0, -200\,000)} - u_{(0, -199\,999)} - \ldots - u_{(0, 200\,000)} and u_{(1, -200\,000)} - u_{(1, -199\,999)} - \ldots - u_{(1, 200\,000)}, connected together by 400\,001 edges (u_{(0, i)}, u_{(1, i)}) for each i. In other words, a grid can be seen as a ladder.  Cactus lady wants to know whether she can embed Cing into this grid, i.e., map each vertex of the cactus onto a separate vertex of the grid while each edge of the cactus will be mapped onto some edge of the grid.
