A progress bar is an element of graphical interface that displays the progress of a process for this very moment before it is completed Lets take a look at the following form of such a barA bar is represented as n squares located in line To add clarity lets number them with positive integers from 1 to n from the left to the right Each square has saturation ai for the ith square which is measured by an integer from 0 to k When the bar for some i 1in is displayed squares 12 i1 has the saturation k squares i1i2 n has the saturation 0 and the saturation of the square i can have any value from 0 to kSo some first squares of the progress bar always have the saturation k Some last squares always have the saturation 0 And there is no more than one square that has the saturation different from 0 and kThe degree of the processs completion is measured in percents Let the process be t completed Then the following inequation is fulfilled An example of such a bar can be seen on the picture  For the given n k t determine the measures of saturation for all the squares ai of the progress bar
