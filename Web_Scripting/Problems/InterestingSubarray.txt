For an array a of integers let's denote its maximal element as \max(a), and minimal as \min(a). We will call an array a of k integers interesting if \max(a) - \min(a) \ge k. For example, array [1, 3, 4, 3] isn't interesting as \max(a) - \min(a) = 4 - 1 = 3 < 4 while array [7, 3, 0, 4, 3] is as \max(a) - \min(a) = 7 - 0 = 7 \ge 5.You are given an array a of n integers. Find some interesting nonempty subarray of a, or tell that it doesn't exist.An array b is a subarray of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.
