The store sells n beads. The color of each bead is described by a lowercase letter of the English alphabet ("a"–"z"). You want to buy some beads to assemble a necklace from them.A necklace is a set of beads connected in a circle.For example, if the store sells beads "a", "b", "c", "a", "c", "c", then you can assemble the following necklaces (these are not all possible options):  And the following necklaces cannot be assembled from beads sold in the store:  The first necklace cannot be assembled because it has three beads "a" (of the two available). The second necklace cannot be assembled because it contains a bead "d", which is not sold in the store. We call a necklace k-beautiful if, when it is turned clockwise by k beads, the necklace remains unchanged. For example, here is a sequence of three turns of a necklace.    As you can see, this necklace is, for example, 3-beautiful, 6-beautiful, 9-beautiful, and so on, but it is not 1-beautiful or 2-beautiful.In particular, a necklace of length 1 is k-beautiful for any integer k. A necklace that consists of beads of the same color is also beautiful for any k.You are given the integers n and k, and also the string s containing n lowercase letters of the English alphabet — each letter defines a bead in the store. You can buy any subset of beads and connect them in any order. Find the maximum length of a k-beautiful necklace you can assemble.
