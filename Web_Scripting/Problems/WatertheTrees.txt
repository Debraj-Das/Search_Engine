There are n trees in a park, numbered from 1 to n. The initial height of the i-th tree is h_i.You want to water these trees, so they all grow to the same height.The watering process goes as follows. You start watering trees at day 1. During the j-th day you can:   Choose a tree and water it. If the day is odd (e.g. 1, 3, 5, 7, \dots), then the height of the tree increases by 1. If the day is even (e.g. 2, 4, 6, 8, \dots), then the height of the tree increases by 2.  Or skip a day without watering any tree. Note that you can't water more than one tree in a day. Your task is to determine the minimum number of days required to water the trees so they grow to the same height.You have to answer t independent test cases.
