A tree is a graph with n vertices and exactly n1 edges this graph should meet the following condition there exists exactly one shortest by number of edges path between any pair of its verticesA subtree of a tree T is a tree with both vertices and edges as subsets of vertices and edges of TYoure given a tree with n vertices Consider its vertices numbered with integers from 1 to n Additionally an integer is written on every vertex of this tree Initially the integer written on the ith vertex is equal to vi In one move you can apply the following operation  Select the subtree of the given tree that includes the vertex with number 1  Increase or decrease by one all the integers which are written on the vertices of that subtree Calculate the minimum number of moves that is required to make all the integers written on the vertices of the given tree equal to zero
