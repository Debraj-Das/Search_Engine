A sequence of positive integers is called great for a positive integer x, if we can split it into pairs in such a way that in each pair the first number multiplied by x is equal to the second number. More formally, a sequence a of size n is great for a positive integer x, if n is even and there exists a permutation p of size n, such that for each i (1 \le i \le \frac{n}{2}) a_{p_{2i-1}} \cdot x = a_{p_{2i}}. Sam has a sequence a and a positive integer x. Help him to make the sequence great: find the minimum possible number of positive integers that should be added to the sequence a to make it great for the number x.
