Tomorrow Ann takes the hardest exam of programming where she should get an excellent mark On the last theoretical class the teacher introduced the notion of a halfpalindrome String t is a halfpalindrome if for all the odd positions i  the following condition is held titti1 where t is the length of string t if positions are indexed from 1 For example strings abaa a bb abbbaa are halfpalindromes and strings ab bba and aaabaa are notAnn knows that on the exam she will get string s consisting only of letters a and b and number k To get an excellent mark she has to find the kth in the lexicographical order string among all substrings of s that are halfpalyndromes Note that each substring in this order is considered as many times as many times it occurs in sThe teachers guarantees that the given number k doesnt exceed the number of substrings of the given string that are halfpalindromesCan you cope with this problem
