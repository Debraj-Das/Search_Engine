A renowned abstract artist Sasha drawing inspiration from nowhere decided to paint a picture entitled Special Olympics He justly thought that if the regular Olympic games have five rings then the Special ones will do with exactly two rings just fineLet us remind you that a ring is a region located between two concentric circles with radii r and R rR These radii are called internal and external respectively Concentric circles are circles with centers located at the same pointSoon a white canvas which can be considered as an infinite Cartesian plane had two perfect rings painted with solid black paint As Sasha is very impulsive the rings could have different radii and sizes they intersect and overlap with each other in any way We know only one thing for sure the centers of the pair of rings are not the sameWhen Sasha got tired and fell into a deep sleep a girl called Ilona came into the room and wanted to cut a circle for the sake of good memories To make the circle beautiful she decided to cut along the contourWell consider a contour to be a continuous closed line through which there is transition from one color to another see notes for clarification If the contour takes the form of a circle then the result will be cutting out a circle which Iona wantsBut the girls inquisitive mathematical mind does not rest how many ways are there to cut a circle out of the canvas
