Multidimensional spaces are completely out of style these days unlike genetics problems  thought physicist Woll and changed his subject of study to bioinformatics Analysing results of sequencing he faced the following problem concerning DNA sequences We will further think of a DNA sequence as an arbitrary string of uppercase letters A C G and T of course this is a simplified interpretationLet w be a long DNA sequence and s1s2sm  collection of short DNA sequences Let us say that the collection filters w iff w can be covered with the sequences from the collection Certainly substrings corresponding to the different positions of the string may intersect or even cover each other More formally denote by w the length of w let symbols of w be numbered from 1 to w Then for each position i in w there exist pair of indices lr 1lirw such that the substring wlr equals one of the elements s1s2sm of the collectionWoll wants to calculate the number of DNA sequences of a given length filtered by a given collection but he doesnt know how to deal with it Help him Your task is to find the number of different DNA sequences of length n filtered by the collection siAnswer may appear very large so output it modulo 1000000009
