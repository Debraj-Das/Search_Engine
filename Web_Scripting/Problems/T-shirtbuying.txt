Each of the t-shirts is characterized by three integers pi, ai and bi, where pi is the price of the i-th t-shirt, ai is front color of the i-th t-shirt and bi is back color of the i-th t-shirt. All values pi are distinct, and values ai and bi are integers from 1 to 3.m buyers will come to the shop. Each of them wants to buy exactly one t-shirt. For the j-th buyer we know his favorite color cj.A buyer agrees to buy a t-shirt, if at least one side (front or back) is painted in his favorite color.
