You are given a binary string of length n. You have exactly k moves. In one move, you must select a single bit. The state of all bits except that bit will get flipped (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0). You need to output the lexicographically largest string that you can get after using all k moves. Also, output the number of times you will select each bit. If there are multiple ways to do this, you may output any of them.A binary string a is lexicographically larger than a binary string b of the same length, if and only if the following holds:   in the first position where a and b differ, the string a contains a 1, and the string b contains a 0.
