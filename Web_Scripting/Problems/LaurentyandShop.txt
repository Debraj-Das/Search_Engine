A little boy Laurenty has been playing his favourite game Nota for quite a while and is now very hungry The boy wants to make sausage and cheese sandwiches but first he needs to buy a sausage and some cheeseThe town where Laurenty lives in is not large The houses in it are located in two rows n houses in each row Laurenty lives in the very last house of the second row The only shop in town is placed in the first house of the first rowThe first and second rows are separated with the main avenue of the city The adjacent houses of one row are separated by streetsEach crosswalk of a street or an avenue has some traffic lights In order to cross the street you need to press a button on the traffic light wait for a while for the green light and cross the street Different traffic lights can have different waiting timeThe traffic light on the crosswalk from the jth house of the ith row to the j1th house of the same row has waiting time equal to aij 1i21jn1 For the traffic light on the crossing from the jth house of one row to the jth house of another row the waiting time equals bj 1jn The city doesnt have any other crossingsThe boy wants to get to the store buy the products and go back The main avenue of the city is wide enough so the boy wants to cross it exactly once on the way to the store and exactly once on the way back home The boy would get bored if he had to walk the same way again so he wants the way home to be different from the way to the store in at least one crossing  Figure to the first sample Help Laurenty determine the minimum total time he needs to wait at the crossroads
