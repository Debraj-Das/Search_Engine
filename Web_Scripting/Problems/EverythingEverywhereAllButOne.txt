You are given an array of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. After you watched the amazing film "Everything Everywhere All At Once", you came up with the following operation.In one operation, you choose n-1 elements of the array and replace each of them with their arithmetic mean (which doesn't have to be an integer). For example, from the array [1, 2, 3, 1] we can get the array [2, 2, 2, 1], if we choose the first three elements, or we can get the array [\frac{4}{3}, \frac{4}{3}, 3, \frac{4}{3}], if we choose all elements except the third.Is it possible to make all elements of the array equal by performing a finite number of such operations?
