One night, Mark realized that there is an essay due tomorrow. He hasn't written anything yet, so Mark decided to randomly copy-paste substrings from the prompt to make the essay.More formally, the prompt is a string s of initial length n. Mark will perform the copy-pasting operation c times. Each operation is described by two integers l and r, which means that Mark will append letters s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r to the end of string s. Note that the length of s increases after this operation.Of course, Mark needs to be able to see what has been written. After copying, Mark will ask q queries: given an integer k, determine the k-th letter of the final string s.
