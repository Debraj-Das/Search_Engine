CQXYM is counting permutations length of 2n.A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).A permutation p(length of 2n) will be counted only if the number of i satisfying p_i<p_{i+1} is no less than n. For example:  Permutation [1, 2, 3, 4] will count, because the number of such i that p_i<p_{i+1} equals 3 (i = 1, i = 2, i = 3). Permutation [3, 2, 1, 4] won't count, because the number of such i that p_i<p_{i+1} equals 1 (i = 3). CQXYM wants you to help him to count the number of such permutations modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).In addition, modulo operation is to get the remainder. For example:  7 \mod 3=1, because 7 = 3 \cdot 2 + 1,  15 \mod 4=3, because 15 = 4 \cdot 3 + 3.
