Mainak has an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of n positive integers. He will do the following operation to this array exactly once:  Pick a subsegment of this array and cyclically rotate it by any amount.  Formally, he can do the following exactly once:  Pick two integers l and r, such that 1 \le l \le r \le n, and any positive integer k.  Repeat this k times: set a_l=a_{l+1}, a_{l+1}=a_{l+2}, \ldots, a_{r-1}=a_r, a_r=a_l (all changes happen at the same time). Mainak wants to maximize the value of (a_n - a_1) after exactly one such operation. Determine the maximum value of (a_n - a_1) that he can obtain.
