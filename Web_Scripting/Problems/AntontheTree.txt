Connected undirected graph without cycles is called a tree Trees is a class of graphs which is interesting not only for people but for ants tooAn ant stands at the root of some tree He sees that there are n vertexes in the tree and they are connected by n1 edges so that there is a path between any pair of vertexes A leaf is a distinct from root vertex which is connected with exactly one other vertexThe ant wants to visit every vertex in the tree and return to the root passing every edge twice In addition he wants to visit the leaves in a specific order You are to find some possible route of the ant
