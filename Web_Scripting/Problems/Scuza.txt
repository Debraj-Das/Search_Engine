Timur has a stairway with n steps. The i-th step is a_i meters higher than its predecessor. The first step is a_1 meters higher than the ground, and the ground starts at 0 meters.   The stairs for the first test case. Timur has q questions, each denoted by an integer k_1, \dots, k_q. For each question k_i, you have to print the maximum possible height Timur can achieve by climbing the steps if his legs are of length k_i. Timur can only climb the j-th step if his legs are of length at least a_j. In other words, k_i \geq a_j for each step j climbed.Note that you should answer each question independently.
