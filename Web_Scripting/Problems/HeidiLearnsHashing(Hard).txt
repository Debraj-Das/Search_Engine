Now Heidi is ready to crack Madame Kovarian's hashing function.Madame Kovarian has a very strict set of rules for name changes. Two names can be interchanged only if using the following hashing function on them results in a collision. However, the hashing function is parametrized, so one can always find a set of parameters that causes such a collision. Heidi decided to exploit this to her advantage.Given two strings w_1, w_2 of equal length n consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer m.Consider the standard polynomial hashing function:H_p(w) := \left( \sum_{i=0}^{|w|-1} w_i r^i \right) \mbox{mod}(p)where p is some prime, and r is some number such that 2\leq r \leq p-2.The goal is to find r and a prime p (m \leq p \leq 10^9) such that H_p(w_1) = H_p(w_2).Strings w_1 and w_2 are sampled independently at random from all strings of length n over lowercase English letters.
