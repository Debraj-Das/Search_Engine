Vus the Cossack has n real numbers a_i. It is known that the sum of all numbers is equal to 0. He wants to choose a sequence b the size of which is n such that the sum of all numbers is 0 and each b_i is either \lfloor a_i \rfloor or \lceil a_i \rceil. In other words, b_i equals a_i rounded up or down. It is not necessary to round to the nearest integer.For example, if a = [4.58413, 1.22491, -2.10517, -3.70387], then b can be equal, for example, to [4, 2, -2, -4]. Note that if a_i is an integer, then there is no difference between \lfloor a_i \rfloor and \lceil a_i \rceil, b_i will always be equal to a_i.Help Vus the Cossack find such sequence!
