Polycarp remembered the 2020-th year, and he is happy with the arrival of the new 2021-th year. To remember such a wonderful moment, Polycarp wants to represent the number n as the sum of a certain number of 2020 and a certain number of 2021.For example, if:   n=4041, then the number n can be represented as the sum 2020 + 2021;  n=4042, then the number n can be represented as the sum 2021 + 2021;  n=8081, then the number n can be represented as the sum 2020 + 2020 + 2020 + 2021;  n=8079, then the number n cannot be represented as the sum of the numbers 2020 and 2021. Help Polycarp to find out whether the number n can be represented as the sum of a certain number of numbers 2020 and a certain number of numbers 2021.
