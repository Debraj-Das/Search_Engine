Volodya has recently visited a very odd town. There are N tourist attractions in the town and every two of them are connected by a bidirectional road. Each road has some travel price (natural number) assigned to it and all prices are distinct. But the most striking thing about this town is that each city sightseeing tour has the same total price! That is, if we choose any city sightseeing tour — a cycle which visits every attraction exactly once — the sum of the costs of the tour roads is independent of the tour. Volodya is curious if you can find such price system with all road prices not greater than 1000.
