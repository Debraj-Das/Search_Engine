Assume that you have k one-dimensional segments s_1, s_2, \dots s_k (each segment is denoted by two integers — its endpoints). Then you can build the following graph on these segments. The graph consists of k vertexes, and there is an edge between the i-th and the j-th vertexes (i \neq j) if and only if the segments s_i and s_j intersect (there exists at least one point that belongs to both of them).For example, if s_1 = [1, 6], s_2 = [8, 20], s_3 = [4, 10], s_4 = [2, 13], s_5 = [17, 18], then the resulting graph is the following:  A tree of size m is good if it is possible to choose m one-dimensional segments so that the graph built on these segments coincides with this tree.You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree.Note that you have to answer q independent queries.
