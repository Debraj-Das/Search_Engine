Let's call a positive integer good if there is no digit 0 in its decimal representation.For an array of a good numbers a, one found out that the sum of some two neighboring elements is equal to x (i.e. x = a_i + a_{i + 1} for some i). x had turned out to be a good number as well.Then the elements of the array a were written out one after another without separators into one string s. For example, if a = [12, 5, 6, 133], then s = 1256133.You are given a string s and a number x. Your task is to determine the positions in the string that correspond to the adjacent elements of the array that have sum x. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.
