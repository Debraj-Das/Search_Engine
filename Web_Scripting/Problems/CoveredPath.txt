The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v1 meters per second, and in the end it is v2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.
