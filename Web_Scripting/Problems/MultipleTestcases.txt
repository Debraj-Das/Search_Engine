So you decided to hold a contest on Codeforces. You prepared the problems: statements, solutions, checkers, validators, tests... Suddenly, your coordinator asks you to change all your tests to multiple testcases in the easiest problem!Initially, each test in that problem is just an array. The maximum size of an array is k. For simplicity, the contents of arrays don't matter. You have n tests — the i-th test is an array of size m_i (1 \le m_i \le k).Your coordinator asks you to distribute all of your arrays into multiple testcases. Each testcase can include multiple arrays. However, each testcase should include no more than c_1 arrays of size greater than or equal to 1 (\ge 1), no more than c_2 arrays of size greater than or equal to 2, \dots, no more than c_k arrays of size greater than or equal to k. Also, c_1 \ge c_2 \ge \dots \ge c_k.So now your goal is to create the new testcases in such a way that:   each of the initial arrays appears in exactly one testcase;  for each testcase the given conditions hold;  the number of testcases is minimum possible. Print the minimum possible number of testcases you can achieve and the sizes of arrays included in each testcase.
