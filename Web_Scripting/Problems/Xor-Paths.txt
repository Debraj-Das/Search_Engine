There is a rectangular grid of size n \times m. Each cell has a number written on it; the number on the cell (i, j) is a_{i, j}. Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (n, m) meeting the following constraints:  You can move to the right or to the bottom only. Formally, from the cell (i, j) you may move to the cell (i, j + 1) or to the cell (i + 1, j). The target cell can't be outside of the grid.  The xor of all the numbers on the path from the cell (1, 1) to the cell (n, m) must be equal to k (xor operation is the bitwise exclusive OR, it is represented as '^' in Java or C++ and "xor" in Pascal). Find the number of such paths in the given grid.
