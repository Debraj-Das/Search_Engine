In this problem we'll use a stack which supports two types of operations:  Push a given number on the stack.  Pop two numbers from the stack, perform a given operation (addition or multiplication) on them and push the result on the stack. You are given a string which describes the sequence of operations to be performed on the stack. i-th character corresponds to i-th operation:  If i-th character is a digit, push the corresponding number on the stack.  If i-th character is «+» or «*», perform the corresponding operation. Initially the stack is empty. Output the topmost number on the stack after executing all given operations.
