You are given an integer sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n.Find the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (1 \le l \le r \le n) such that the value of median of a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r is exactly the given number m.The median of a sequence is the value of an element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.For example, if a=[4, 2, 7, 5] then its median is 4 since after sorting the sequence, it will look like [2, 4, 5, 7] and the left of two middle elements is equal to 4. The median of [7, 1, 2, 9, 6] equals 6 since after sorting, the value 6 will be in the middle of the sequence.Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (1 \le l \le r \le n) such that the value of median of a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r is exactly the given number m.
