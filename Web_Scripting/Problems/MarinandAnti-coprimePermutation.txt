Marin wants you to count number of permutations that are beautiful. A beautiful permutation of length n is a permutation that has the following property:  \gcd (1 \cdot p_1, \, 2 \cdot p_2, \, \dots, \, n \cdot p_n) > 1,  where \gcd is the greatest common divisor.A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3, 4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
