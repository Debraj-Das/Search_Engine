You are given a permutation a consisting of n numbers 1, 2, ..., n (a permutation is an array in which each element from 1 to n occurs exactly once).You can perform the following operation: choose some subarray (contiguous subsegment) of a and rearrange the elements in it in any way you want. But this operation cannot be applied to the whole array.For example, if a = [2, 1, 4, 5, 3] and we want to apply the operation to the subarray a[2, 4] (the subarray containing all elements from the 2-nd to the 4-th), then after the operation, the array can become a = [2, 5, 1, 4, 3] or, for example, a = [2, 1, 5, 4, 3].Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations described above to sort the permutation a in ascending order.
