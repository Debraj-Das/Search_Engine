You are given five integers n, i, j, x, and y. Find the number of bitonic permutations B, of the numbers 1 to n, such that B_i=x, and B_j=y. Since the answer can be large, compute it modulo 10^9+7.A bitonic permutation is a permutation of numbers, such that the elements of the permutation first increase till a certain index k, 2 \le k \le n-1, and then decrease till the end.
