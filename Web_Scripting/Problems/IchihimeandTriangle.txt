Ichihime is the current priestess of the Mahjong Soul Temple. She claims to be human, despite her cat ears.These days the temple is holding a math contest. Usually, Ichihime lacks interest in these things, but this time the prize for the winner is her favorite — cookies. Ichihime decides to attend the contest. Now she is solving the following problem. You are given four positive integers a, b, c, d, such that a \leq b \leq c \leq d. Your task is to find three integers x, y, z, satisfying the following conditions: a \leq x \leq b. b \leq y \leq c. c \leq z \leq d. There exists a triangle with a positive non-zero area and the lengths of its three sides are x, y, and z.Ichihime desires to get the cookie, but the problem seems too hard for her. Can you help her?
