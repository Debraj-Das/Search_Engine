You are given an array a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}. You can remove at most one subsegment from it. The remaining elements should be pairwise distinct.In other words, at most one time you can choose two integers l and r (1 \leq l \leq r \leq n) and delete integers a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r from the array. Remaining elements should be pairwise distinct. Find the minimum size of the subsegment you need to remove to make all remaining elements distinct.
