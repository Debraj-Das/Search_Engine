Two players are playing a game. First each of them writes an integer from 1 to 6, and then a dice is thrown. The player whose written number got closer to the number on the dice wins. If both payers have the same difference, it's a draw.The first player wrote number a, the second player wrote number b. How many ways to throw a dice are there, at which the first player wins, or there is a draw, or the second player wins?
