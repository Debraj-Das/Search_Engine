Ivan places knights on infinite chessboard. Initially there are n knights. If there is free cell which is under attack of at least 4 knights then he places new knight in this cell. Ivan repeats this until there are no such free cells. One can prove that this process is finite. One can also prove that position in the end does not depend on the order in which new knights are placed.Ivan asked you to find initial placement of exactly n knights such that in the end there will be at least \lfloor \frac{n^{2}}{10} \rfloor knights.
