You are given integers n, k. Let's consider the alphabet consisting of k different elements.Let beauty f(s) of the string s be the number of indexes i, 1\le i<|s|, for which prefix of s of length i equals to suffix of s of length i. For example, beauty of the string abacaba equals 2, as for i = 1, 3 prefix and suffix of length i are equal.Consider all words of length n in the given alphabet. Find the expected value of f(s)^2 of a uniformly chosen at random word. We can show that it can be expressed as \frac{P}{Q}, where P and Q are coprime and Q isn't divided by 10^9 + 7. Output P\cdot Q^{-1} \bmod 10^9 + 7.
