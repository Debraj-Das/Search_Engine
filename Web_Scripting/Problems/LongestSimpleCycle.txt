You have n chains, the i-th chain consists of c_i vertices. Vertices in each chain are numbered independently from 1 to c_i along the chain. In other words, the i-th chain is the undirected graph with c_i vertices and (c_i - 1) edges connecting the j-th and the (j + 1)-th vertices for each 1 \le j < c_i.Now you decided to unite chains in one graph in the following way:   the first chain is skipped;  the 1-st vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the a_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain;  the last (c_i-th) vertex of the i-th chain is connected by an edge with the b_i-th vertex of the (i - 1)-th chain.   Picture of the first test case. Dotted lines are the edges added during uniting process Calculate the length of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph.A simple cycle is a chain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel along the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly once.
