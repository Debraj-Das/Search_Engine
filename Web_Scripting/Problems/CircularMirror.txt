Pak Chanek has a mirror in the shape of a circle. There are N lamps on the circumference numbered from 1 to N in clockwise order. The length of the arc from lamp i to lamp i+1 is D_i for 1 \leq i \leq N-1. Meanwhile, the length of the arc between lamp N and lamp 1 is D_N.Pak Chanek wants to colour the lamps with M different colours. Each lamp can be coloured with one of the M colours. However, there cannot be three different lamps such that the colours of the three lamps are the same and the triangle made by considering the three lamps as vertices is a right triangle (triangle with one of its angles being exactly 90 degrees).The following are examples of lamp colouring configurations on the circular mirror. Figure 1. an example of an incorrect colouring because lamps 1, 2, and 3 form a right triangleFigure 2. an example of a correct colouringFigure 3. an example of a correct colouring Before colouring the lamps, Pak Chanek wants to know the number of distinct colouring configurations he can make. Count the number of distinct possible lamp colouring configurations, modulo 998\,244\,353.
