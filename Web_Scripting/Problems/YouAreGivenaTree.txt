A tree is an undirected graph with exactly one simple path between each pair of vertices. We call a set of simple paths k-valid if each vertex of the tree belongs to no more than one of these paths (including endpoints) and each path consists of exactly k vertices.You are given a tree with n vertices. For each k from 1 to n inclusive find what is the maximum possible size of a k-valid set of simple paths.
