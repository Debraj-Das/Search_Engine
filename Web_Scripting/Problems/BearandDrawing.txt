Limak is a little bear who learns to draw People usually start with houses fences and flowers but why would bears do it Limak lives in the forest and he decides to draw a treeRecall that tree is a connected graph consisting of n vertices and n1 edgesLimak chose a tree with n vertices He has infinite strip of paper with two parallel rows of dots Little bear wants to assign vertices of a tree to some n distinct dots on a paper so that edges would intersect only at their endpoints  drawn tree must be planar Below you can see one of correct drawings for the first sample test  Is it possible for Limak to draw chosen tree
