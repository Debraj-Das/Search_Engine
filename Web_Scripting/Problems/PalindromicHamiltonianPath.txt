You are given a simple undirected graph with n vertices, n is even. You are going to write a letter on each vertex. Each letter should be one of the first k letters of the Latin alphabet.A path in the graph is called Hamiltonian if it visits each vertex exactly once. A string is called palindromic if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left. A path in the graph is called palindromic if the letters on the vertices in it spell a palindromic string without changing the order.A string of length n is good if:   each letter is one of the first k lowercase Latin letters;  if you write the i-th letter of the string on the i-th vertex of the graph, there will exist a palindromic Hamiltonian path in the graph. Note that the path doesn't necesserily go through the vertices in order 1, 2, \dots, n.Count the number of good strings.
