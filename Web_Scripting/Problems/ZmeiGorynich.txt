You are fighting with Zmei Gorynich — a ferocious monster from Slavic myths, a huge dragon-like reptile with multiple heads!   Initially Zmei Gorynich has x heads. You can deal n types of blows. If you deal a blow of the i-th type, you decrease the number of Gorynich's heads by min(d_i, curX), there curX is the current number of heads. But if after this blow Zmei Gorynich has at least one head, he grows h_i new heads. If curX = 0 then Gorynich is defeated. You can deal each blow any number of times, in any order.For example, if curX = 10, d = 7, h = 10 then the number of heads changes to 13 (you cut 7 heads off, but then Zmei grows 10 new ones), but if curX = 10, d = 11, h = 100 then number of heads changes to 0 and Zmei Gorynich is considered defeated.Calculate the minimum number of blows to defeat Zmei Gorynich!You have to answer t independent queries.
