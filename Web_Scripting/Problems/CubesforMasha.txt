Absent-minded Masha got set of n cubes for her birthday.At each of 6 faces of each cube, there is exactly one digit from 0 to 9. Masha became interested what is the largest natural x such she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 to x.To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.
