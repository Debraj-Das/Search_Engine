You are given a complete bipartite graph with 2n nodes, with n nodes on each side of the bipartition. Nodes 1 through n are on one side of the bipartition, and nodes n+1 to 2n are on the other side. You are also given an n \times n matrix a describing the edge weights. a_{ij} denotes the weight of the edge between nodes i and j+n. Each edge has a distinct weight.Alice and Bob are playing a game on this graph. First Alice chooses to play as either "increasing" or "decreasing" for herself, and Bob gets the other choice. Then she places a token on any node of the graph. Bob then moves the token along any edge incident to that node. They now take turns playing the following game, with Alice going first.The current player must move the token from the current vertex to some adjacent unvisited vertex. Let w be the last weight of the last edge that was traversed. The edge that is traversed must be strictly greater than w if the player is playing as "increasing", otherwise, it must be strictly less. The first player unable to make a move loses.You are given n and the edge weights of the graph. You can choose to play as either Alice or Bob, and you will play against the judge. You must win all the games for your answer to be judged correct.
