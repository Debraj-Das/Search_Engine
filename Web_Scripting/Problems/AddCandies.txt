There are n bags with candies, initially the i-th bag contains i candies. You want all the bags to contain an equal amount of candies in the end. To achieve this, you will: Choose m such that 1 \le m \le 1000Perform m operations. In the j-th operation, you will pick one bag and add j candies to all bags apart from the chosen one.Your goal is to find a valid sequence of operations after which all the bags will contain an equal amount of candies. It can be proved that for the given constraints such a sequence always exists.You don't have to minimize m.If there are several valid sequences, you can output any.
