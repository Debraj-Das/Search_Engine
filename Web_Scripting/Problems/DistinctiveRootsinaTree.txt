You are given a tree with n vertices. Each vertex i has a value a_i associated with it.Let us root the tree at some vertex v. The vertex v is called a distinctive root if the following holds: in all paths that start at v and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values.Find the number of distinctive roots in the tree.
