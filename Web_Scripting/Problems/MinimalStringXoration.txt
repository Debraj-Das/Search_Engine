You are given an integer n and a string s consisting of 2^n lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The characters of the string s are s_0s_1s_2\cdots s_{2^n-1}.A string t of length 2^n (whose characters are denoted by t_0t_1t_2\cdots t_{2^n-1}) is a xoration of s if there exists an integer j (0\le j \leq 2^n-1) such that, for each 0 \leq i \leq 2^n-1, t_i = s_{i \oplus j} (where \oplus denotes the operation bitwise XOR).Find the lexicographically minimal xoration of s.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:   a is a prefix of b, but a \ne b;  in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
