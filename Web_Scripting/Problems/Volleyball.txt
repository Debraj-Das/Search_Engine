Petya loves volleyball very much. One day he was running late for a volleyball match. Petya hasn't bought his own car yet, that's why he had to take a taxi. The city has n junctions, some of which are connected by two-way roads. The length of each road is defined by some positive integer number of meters; the roads can have different lengths.Initially each junction has exactly one taxi standing there. The taxi driver from the i-th junction agrees to drive Petya (perhaps through several intermediate junctions) to some other junction if the travel distance is not more than ti meters. Also, the cost of the ride doesn't depend on the distance and is equal to ci bourles. Taxis can't stop in the middle of a road. Each taxi can be used no more than once. Petya can catch taxi only in the junction, where it stands initially.At the moment Petya is located on the junction x and the volleyball stadium is on the junction y. Determine the minimum amount of money Petya will need to drive to the stadium.
