The Little Elephant has two permutations a and b of length n consisting of numbers from 1 to n inclusive Lets denote the ith 1in element of the permutation a as ai the jth 1jn element of the permutation b  as bjThe distance between permutations a and b is the minimum absolute value of the difference between the positions of the occurrences of some number in a and in b More formally its such minimum ij that aibjA cyclic shift number i 1in of permutation b consisting from n elements is a permutation bibi1 bnb1b2 bi1 Overall a permutation has n cyclic shiftsThe Little Elephant wonders for all cyclic shifts of permutation b what is the distance between the cyclic shift and permutation a
