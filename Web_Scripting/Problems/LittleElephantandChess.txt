The Little Elephant loves chess very much One day the Little Elephant and his friend decided to play chess Theyve got the chess pieces but the board is a problem Theyve got an 88 checkered board each square is painted either black or white The Little Elephant and his friend know that a proper chessboard doesnt have any sideadjacent cells with the same color and the upper left cell is white To play chess they want to make the board they have a proper chessboard For that the friends can choose any row of the board and cyclically shift the cells of the chosen row that is put the last rightmost square on the first place in the row and shift the others one position to the right You can run the described operation multiple times or not run it at allFor example if the first line of the board looks like that BBBBBBWW the white cells of the line are marked with character W the black cells are marked with character B then after one cyclic shift it will look like that WBBBBBBWHelp the Little Elephant and his friend to find out whether they can use any number of the described operations to turn the board they have into a proper chessboard
