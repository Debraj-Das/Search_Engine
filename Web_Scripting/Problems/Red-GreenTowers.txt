There are r red and g green blocks for construction of the redgreen tower Redgreen tower can be built following next rules  Redgreen tower is consisting of some number of levels  Let the redgreen tower consist of n levels then the first level of this tower should consist of n blocks second level  of n1 blocks the third one  of n2 blocks and so on  the last level of such tower should consist of the one block In other words each successive level should contain one block less than the previous one  Each level of the redgreen tower should contain blocks of the same color  Let h be the maximum possible number of levels of redgreen tower that can be built out of r red and g green blocks meeting the rules above The task is to determine how many different redgreen towers having h levels can be built out of the available blocksTwo redgreen towers are considered different if there exists some level that consists of red blocks in the one tower and consists of green blocks in the other towerYou are to write a program that will find the number of different redgreen towers of height h modulo1097
