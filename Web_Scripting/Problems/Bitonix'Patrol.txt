Byteland is trying to send a space mission onto the BitX planet Their task is complicated by the fact that the orbit of the planet is regularly patrolled by Captain Bitonix the leader of the space forces of BitXThere are n stations around BitX numbered clockwise from 1 to n The stations are evenly placed on a circular orbit so the stations number i and i1 1in and the stations number 1 and n are neighboring The distance between every pair of adjacent stations is equal to m space miles To go on a patrol Captain Bitonix jumps in his rocket at one of the stations and flies in a circle covering a distance of at least one space mile before finishing in some perhaps the starting stationBitonix rocket moves by burning fuel tanks After Bitonix attaches an xliter fuel tank and chooses the direction clockwise or counterclockwise the rocket flies exactly x space miles along a circular orbit in the chosen direction Note that the rocket has no brakes it is not possible for the rocket to stop before depleting a fuel tankFor example assume that n3 and m60 and Bitonix has fuel tanks with volumes of 10 60 90 and 100 liters If Bitonix starts from station 1 uses the 100liter fuel tank to go clockwise then uses the 90liter fuel tank to go clockwise and then uses the 10liter fuel tank to go counterclockwise he will finish back at station 1 This constitutes a valid patrol Note that Bitonix does not have to use all available fuel tanks Another valid option for Bitonix in this example would be to simply use the 60liter fuel tank to fly to either station 2 or 3However if n was equal to 3 m was equal to 60 and the only fuel tanks available to Bitonix were one 10liter tank and one 100liter tank he would have no way of completing a valid patrol he wouldnt be able to finish any patrol exactly at the stationThe Byteland space agency wants to destroy some of Captain Bitonix fuel tanks so that he cannot to complete any valid patrol Find how many different subsets of the tanks the agency can destroy to prevent Captain Bitonix from completing a patrol and output the answer modulo 1000000007 1097
