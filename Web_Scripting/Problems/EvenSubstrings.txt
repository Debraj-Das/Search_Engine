You are given a string s=s_1s_2\dots s_n of length n, which only contains digits 1, 2, ..., 9.A substring s[l \dots r] of s is a string s_l s_{l + 1} s_{l + 2} \ldots s_r. A substring s[l \dots r] of s is called even if the number represented by it is even. Find the number of even substrings of s. Note, that even if some substrings are equal as strings, but have different l and r, they are counted as different substrings.
