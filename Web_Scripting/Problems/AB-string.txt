The string t_1t_2 \dots t_k is good if each letter of this string belongs to at least one palindrome of length greater than 1.A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the strings A, BAB, ABBA, BAABBBAAB are palindromes, but the strings AB, ABBBAA, BBBA are not.Here are some examples of good strings:   t = AABBB (letters t_1, t_2 belong to palindrome t_1 \dots t_2 and letters t_3, t_4, t_5 belong to palindrome t_3 \dots t_5);  t = ABAA (letters t_1, t_2, t_3 belong to palindrome t_1 \dots t_3 and letter t_4 belongs to palindrome t_3 \dots t_4);  t = AAAAA (all letters belong to palindrome t_1 \dots t_5); You are given a string s of length n, consisting of only letters A and B.You have to calculate the number of good substrings of string s.
