There is an infinite pond that can be represented with a number line. There are n rocks in the pond, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th rock is located at an integer coordinate a_i. The coordinates of the rocks are pairwise distinct. The rocks are numbered in the increasing order of the coordinate, so a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n.A robot frog sits on the rock number s. The frog is programmable. It has a base jumping distance parameter d. There also is a setting for the jumping distance range. If the jumping distance range is set to some integer k, then the frog can jump from some rock to any rock at a distance from d - k to d + k inclusive in any direction. The distance between two rocks is an absolute difference between their coordinates.You are assigned a task to implement a feature for the frog. Given two integers i and k determine if the frog can reach a rock number i from a rock number s performing a sequence of jumps with the jumping distance range set to k. The sequence can be arbitrarily long or empty.You will be given q testcases for that feature, the j-th testcase consists of two integers i and k. Print "Yes" if the i-th rock is reachable and "No" otherwise.You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and 'YES"' will be recognized as a positive answer).
