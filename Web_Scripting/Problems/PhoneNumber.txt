Alas finding ones true love is not easy Masha has been unsuccessful in that yet Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of ones Prince Charming through arithmancy The phone number is divined like that First one needs to write down ones own phone numbers For example lets suppose that Mashas phone number is 12345 After that one should write her favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number That will be the first digit of the needed number For example Mashas favorite digit is 9 The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of Mashas number and the already written down first digit from her beloved ones number In this case the arithmetic average equals to 29255 Masha can round the number up or down depending on her wishes For example she chooses the digit 5 Having written down the resulting digit under the second digit of her number Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way ie finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second digit of the new number The result is 5324 In this case the answer is unique Thus every ith digit is determined as an arithmetic average of the ith digit of Mashas number and the i1th digit of her true loves number If needed the digit can be rounded up or down For example Masha can get 12345 95444 Unfortunately when Masha tried dialing the number she got disappointed as it turned out the number was unavailable or outside the coverage area But Masha wont give up Perhaps she rounded to a wrong digit or chose the first digit badly Thats why she keeps finding more and more new numbers and calling them Count the number of numbers Masha calls Masha calls all the possible numbers that can be found by the described means of arithmancy except for perhaps her own one
