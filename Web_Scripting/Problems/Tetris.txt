You are given a following process. There is a platform with n columns. 1 \times 1 squares are appearing one after another in some columns on this platform. If there are no squares in the column, a square will occupy the bottom row. Otherwise a square will appear at the top of the highest square of this column. When all of the n columns have at least one square in them, the bottom row is being removed. You will receive 1 point for this, and all the squares left will fall down one row. You task is to calculate the amount of points you will receive.
