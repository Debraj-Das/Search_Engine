Koa the Koala has a matrix A of n rows and m columns. Elements of this matrix are distinct integers from 1 to n \cdot m (each number from 1 to n \cdot m appears exactly once in the matrix).For any matrix M of n rows and m columns let's define the following:  The i-th row of M is defined as R_i(M) = [ M_{i1}, M_{i2}, \ldots, M_{im} ] for all i (1 \le i \le n).  The j-th column of M is defined as C_j(M) = [ M_{1j}, M_{2j}, \ldots, M_{nj} ] for all j (1 \le j \le m). Koa defines S(A) = (X, Y) as the spectrum of A, where X is the set of the maximum values in rows of A and Y is the set of the maximum values in columns of A.More formally:  X = \{ \max(R_1(A)), \max(R_2(A)), \ldots, \max(R_n(A)) \}  Y = \{ \max(C_1(A)), \max(C_2(A)), \ldots, \max(C_m(A)) \}Koa asks you to find some matrix A' of n rows and m columns, such that each number from 1 to n \cdot m appears exactly once in the matrix, and the following conditions hold:  S(A') = S(A)  R_i(A') is bitonic for all i (1 \le i \le n)  C_j(A') is bitonic for all j (1 \le j \le m)  An array t (t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k) is called bitonic if it first increases and then decreases. More formally: t is bitonic if there exists some position p (1 \le p \le k) such that: t_1 < t_2 < \ldots < t_p > t_{p+1} > \ldots > t_k.Help Koa to find such matrix or to determine that it doesn't exist.
