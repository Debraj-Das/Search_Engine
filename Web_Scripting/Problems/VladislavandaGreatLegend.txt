A great legend used to be here, but some troll hacked Codeforces and erased it. Too bad for us, but in the troll society he earned a title of an ultimate-greatest-over troll. At least for them, it's something good. And maybe a formal statement will be even better for us?You are given a tree T with n vertices numbered from 1 to n. For every non-empty subset X of vertices of T, let f(X) be the minimum number of edges in the smallest connected subtree of T which contains every vertex from X.You're also given an integer k. You need to compute the sum of (f(X))^k among all non-empty subsets of vertices, that is: \sum\limits_{X \subseteq \{1, 2,\: \dots \:, n\},\, X \neq \varnothing} (f(X))^k. As the result might be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.
