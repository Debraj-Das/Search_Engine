A sequence of n numbers is called permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the sequences [3, 1, 4, 2], [1] and [2,1] are permutations, but [1,2,1], [0,1] and [1,3,4] — are not.Kristina had a permutation p of n elements. She wrote it on the whiteboard n times in such a way that:   while writing the permutation at the i-th (1 \le i \le n) time she skipped the element p_i  So, she wrote in total n sequences of length n-1 each.For example, suppose Kristina had a permutation p = [4,2,1,3] of length 4. Then she did the following:   Wrote the sequence [2, 1, 3], skipping the element p_1=4 from the original permutation.  Wrote the sequence [4, 1, 3], skipping the element p_2=2 from the original permutation.  Wrote the sequence [4, 2, 3], skipping the element p_3=1 from the original permutation.  Wrote the sequence [4, 2, 1], skipping the element p_4=3 from the original permutation. You know all n of sequences that have been written on the whiteboard, but you do not know the order in which they were written. They are given in arbitrary order. Reconstruct the original permutation from them.For example, if you know the sequences [4, 2, 1], [4, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3], [4, 1, 3], then the original permutation will be p = [4, 2, 1, 3].
