Teachers of one programming summer school decided to make a surprise for the students by giving them names in the style of the "Hobbit" movie. Each student must get a pseudonym maximally similar to his own name. The pseudonym must be a name of some character of the popular saga and now the teachers are busy matching pseudonyms to student names.There are n students in a summer school. Teachers chose exactly n pseudonyms for them. Each student must get exactly one pseudonym corresponding to him. Let us determine the relevance of a pseudonym b to a student with name a as the length of the largest common prefix a and b. We will represent such value as . Then we can determine the quality of matching of the pseudonyms to students as a sum of relevances of all pseudonyms to the corresponding students.Find the matching between students and pseudonyms with the maximum quality.
