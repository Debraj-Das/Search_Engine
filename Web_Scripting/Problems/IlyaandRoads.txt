Everything is great about Ilya's city, except the roads. The thing is, the only ZooVille road is represented as n holes in a row. We will consider the holes numbered from 1 to n, from left to right.Ilya is really keep on helping his city. So, he wants to fix at least k holes (perharps he can fix more) on a single ZooVille road. The city has m building companies, the i-th company needs ci money units to fix a road segment containing holes with numbers of at least li and at most ri. The companies in ZooVille are very greedy, so, if they fix a segment containing some already fixed holes, they do not decrease the price for fixing the segment. Determine the minimum money Ilya will need to fix at least k holes.
