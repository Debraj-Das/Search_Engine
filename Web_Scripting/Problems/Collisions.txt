On a number line there are n balls. At time moment 0 for each ball the following data is known: its coordinate xi, speed vi (possibly, negative) and weight mi. The radius of the balls can be ignored.The balls collide elastically, i.e. if two balls weighing m1 and m2 and with speeds v1 and v2 collide, their new speeds will be: .Your task is to find out, where each ball will be t seconds after.
