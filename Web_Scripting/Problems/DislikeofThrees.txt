Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by 3 or end with the digit 3 in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than 0) integers which he likes: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, \dots. Output the k-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from 1).
