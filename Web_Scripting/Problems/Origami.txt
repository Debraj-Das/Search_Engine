After being discouraged by 13 time-limit-exceeded verdicts on an ugly geometry problem, you decided to take a relaxing break for arts and crafts.There is a piece of paper in the shape of a simple polygon with n vertices. The polygon may be non-convex, but we all know that proper origami paper has the property that any horizontal line intersects the boundary of the polygon in at most two points.If you fold the paper along the vertical line x=f, what will be the area of the resulting shape? When you fold, the part of the paper to the left of the line is symmetrically reflected on the right side.  Your task is to answer q independent queries for values f_1,\ldots,f_q.
