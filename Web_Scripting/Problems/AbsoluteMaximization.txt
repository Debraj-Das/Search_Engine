You are given an array a of length n. You can perform the following operation several (possibly, zero) times:  Choose i, j, b: Swap the b-th digit in the binary representation of a_i and a_j. Find the maximum possible value of \max(a) - \min(a).In a binary representation, bits are numbered from right (least significant) to left (most significant). Consider that there are an infinite number of leading zero bits at the beginning of any binary representation.For example, swap the 0-th bit for 4=100_2 and 3=11_2 will result 101_2=5 and 10_2=2. Swap the 2-nd bit for 4=100_2 and 3=11_2 will result 000_2=0_2=0 and 111_2=7. Here, \max(a) denotes the maximum element of array a and \min(a) denotes the minimum element of array a.The binary representation of x is x written in base 2. For example, 9 and 6 written in base 2 are 1001 and 110, respectively.
