You are given an unsorted permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n. To sort the permutation, you choose a constant k (k \ge 1) and do some operations on the permutation. In one operation, you can choose two integers i, j (1 \le j < i \le n) such that i - j = k, then swap p_i and p_j.What is the maximum value of k that you can choose to sort the given permutation?A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation, but [1, 2, 2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1, 3, 4] is also not a permutation (n = 3 but there is 4 in the array).An unsorted permutation p is a permutation such that there is at least one position i that satisfies p_i \ne i.
