Nikita likes tasks on order statistics, for example, he can easily find the k-th number in increasing order on a segment of an array. But now Nikita wonders how many segments of an array there are such that a given number x is the k-th number in increasing order on this segment. In other words, you should find the number of segments of a given array such that there are exactly k numbers of this segment which are less than x.Nikita wants to get answer for this question for each k from 0 to n, where n is the size of the array.
