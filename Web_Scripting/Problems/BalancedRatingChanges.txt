Another Codeforces Round has just finished! It has gathered n participants, and according to the results, the expected rating change of participant i is a_i. These rating changes are perfectly balanced — their sum is equal to 0.Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declared semi-rated. It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.There are two conditions though:   For each participant i, their modified rating change b_i must be integer, and as close to \frac{a_i}{2} as possible. It means that either b_i = \lfloor \frac{a_i}{2} \rfloor or b_i = \lceil \frac{a_i}{2} \rceil. In particular, if a_i is even, b_i = \frac{a_i}{2}. Here \lfloor x \rfloor denotes rounding down to the largest integer not greater than x, and \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up to the smallest integer not smaller than x.  The modified rating changes must be perfectly balanced — their sum must be equal to 0. Can you help with that?
