Tokitsukaze is arranging a meeting. There are n rows and m columns of seats in the meeting hall.There are exactly n \cdot m students attending the meeting, including several naughty students and several serious students. The students are numerated from 1 to n\cdot m. The students will enter the meeting hall in order. When the i-th student enters the meeting hall, he will sit in the 1-st column of the 1-st row, and the students who are already seated will move back one seat. Specifically, the student sitting in the j-th (1\leq j \leq m-1) column of the i-th row will move to the (j+1)-th column of the i-th row, and the student sitting in m-th column of the i-th row will move to the 1-st column of the (i+1)-th row.For example, there is a meeting hall with 2 rows and 2 columns of seats shown as below:  There will be 4 students entering the meeting hall in order, represented as a binary string "1100", of which '0' represents naughty students and '1' represents serious students. The changes of seats in the meeting hall are as follows:  Denote a row or a column good if and only if there is at least one serious student in this row or column. Please predict the number of good rows and columns just after the i-th student enters the meeting hall, for all i.
