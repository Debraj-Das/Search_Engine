Recently you have received two positive integer numbers x and y. You forgot them, but you remembered a shuffled list containing all divisors of x (including 1 and x) and all divisors of y (including 1 and y). If d is a divisor of both numbers x and y at the same time, there are two occurrences of d in the list.For example, if x=4 and y=6 then the given list can be any permutation of the list [1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6]. Some of the possible lists are: [1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 2], [4, 6, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2] or [1, 6, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2].Your problem is to restore suitable positive integer numbers x and y that would yield the same list of divisors (possibly in different order).It is guaranteed that the answer exists, i.e. the given list of divisors corresponds to some positive integers x and y.
