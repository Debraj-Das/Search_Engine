Vasya is sitting on an extremely boring math class To have fun he took a piece of paper and wrote out n numbers on a single line After that Vasya began to write out different ways to put pluses  in the line between certain digits in the line so that the result was a correct arithmetic expression formally no two pluses in such a partition can stand together between any two adjacent pluses there must be at least one digit and no plus can stand at the beginning or the end of a line For example in the string 100500 ways 100500 add no pluses 100500 or 100500 are correct and ways 100500 100500 or 100500 are incorrectThe lesson was long and Vasya has written all the correct ways to place exactly k pluses in a string of digits At this point he got caught having fun by a teacher and he was given the task to calculate the sum of all the resulting arithmetic expressions by the end of the lesson when calculating the value of an expression the leading zeros should be ignored As the answer can be large Vasya is allowed to get only its remainder modulo 1097 Help him
