Recently the construction of Berland collider has been completed. Collider can be represented as a long narrow tunnel that contains n particles. We associate with collider 1-dimensional coordinate system, going from left to right. For each particle we know its coordinate and velocity at the moment of start of the collider. The velocities of the particles don't change after the launch of the collider. Berland scientists think that the big bang will happen at the first collision of particles, whose velocities differs in directions. Help them to determine how much time elapses after the launch of the collider before the big bang happens.
