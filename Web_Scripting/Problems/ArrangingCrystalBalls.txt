In the world of Compfestnesia, Pak Chanek discovers a secret underground dungeon. Inside it, there is a treasure chest that is surrounded by n statues that are arranged in a circular manner. The statues are numbered from 0 to n-1 with statue i being to the left of statue i+1 and statue n-1 being to the left of statue 0.Pak Chanek observes that each statue is holding a crystal ball with an integer between 0 and m-1 inclusive. Let's say the integer in the crystal ball of statue i is a_i.The dungeon provides instructions that every integer in the crystal balls must be 0 in order to open the treasure chest. To achieve that, Pak Chanek is given an integer k, and he can do zero or more operations. In a single operation, Pak Chanek does the following:   Choose exactly k consecutive statues. In other words, choose the statues p, (p+1) \bmod n, (p+2) \bmod n, (p+3) \bmod n, \ldots, (p+k-1) \bmod n for some chosen index p.  Do one of the following:   For all chosen statues, change their values of a_i into (a_i+1) \bmod m.  For all chosen statues, change their values of a_i into (a_i-1) \bmod m.  Help Pak Chanek find the minimum possible number of operations to open the treasure chest.
