Recently a new building with a new layout was constructed in Monocarp's hometown. According to this new layout, the building consists of three types of apartments: three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. It's also known that each room of each apartment has exactly one window. In other words, a three-room apartment has three windows, a five-room — five windows, and a seven-room — seven windows.Monocarp went around the building and counted n windows. Now he is wondering, how many apartments of each type the building may have.Unfortunately, Monocarp only recently has learned to count, so he is asking you to help him to calculate the possible quantities of three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments in the building that has n windows. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.Here are some examples:  if Monocarp has counted 30 windows, there could have been 2 three-room apartments, 2 five-room apartments and 2 seven-room apartments, since 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 7 = 30;  if Monocarp has counted 67 windows, there could have been 7 three-room apartments, 5 five-room apartments and 3 seven-room apartments, since 7 \cdot 3 + 5 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 7 = 67;  if Monocarp has counted 4 windows, he should have mistaken since no building with the aforementioned layout can have 4 windows.
