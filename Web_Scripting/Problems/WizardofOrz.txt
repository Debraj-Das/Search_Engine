There are n digital panels placed in a straight line Each panel can show any digit from 0 to 9 Initially all panels show 0Every second the digit shown by each panel increases by 1 In other words at the end of every second a panel that showed 9 would now show 0 a panel that showed 0 would now show 1 a panel that showed 1 would now show 2 and so onWhen a panel is paused the digit displayed on the panel does not change in the subsequent secondsYou must pause exactly one of these panels at any second you wish Then the panels adjacent to it get paused one second later the panels adjacent to those get paused 2 seconds later and so on In other words if you pause panel x panel y for all valid y would be paused exactly xy seconds laterFor example suppose there are 4 panels and the 3rd panel is paused when the digit 9 is on it  The panel 1 pauses 2 seconds later so it has the digit 1  the panel 2 pauses 1 second later so it has the digit 0  the panel 4 pauses 1 second later so it has the digit 0 The resulting 4digit number is 1090 Note that this example is not optimal for n  4Once all panels have been paused you write the digits displayed on them from left to right to form an n digit number it can consist of leading zeros What is the largest possible number you can get Initially all panels show 0
