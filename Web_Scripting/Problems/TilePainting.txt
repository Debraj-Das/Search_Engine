Ujan has been lazy lately, but now has decided to bring his yard to good shape. First, he decided to paint the path from his house to the gate.The path consists of n consecutive tiles, numbered from 1 to n. Ujan will paint each tile in some color. He will consider the path aesthetic if for any two different tiles with numbers i and j, such that |j - i| is a divisor of n greater than 1, they have the same color. Formally, the colors of two tiles with numbers i and j should be the same if |i-j| > 1 and n \bmod |i-j| = 0 (where x \bmod y is the remainder when dividing x by y).Ujan wants to brighten up space. What is the maximum number of different colors that Ujan can use, so that the path is aesthetic?
