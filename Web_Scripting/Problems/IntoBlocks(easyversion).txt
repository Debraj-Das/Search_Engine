This is an easier version of the next problem. In this version, q = 0.A sequence of integers is called nice if its elements are arranged in blocks like in [3, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1]. Formally, if two elements are equal, everything in between must also be equal.Let's define difficulty of a sequence as a minimum possible number of elements to change to get a nice sequence. However, if you change at least one element of value x to value y, you must also change all other elements of value x into y as well. For example, for [3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2] it isn't allowed to change first 1 to 3 and second 1 to 2. You need to leave 1's untouched or change them to the same value.You are given a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n and q updates.Each update is of form "i x" — change a_i to x. Updates are not independent (the change stays for the future).Print the difficulty of the initial sequence and of the sequence after every update.
