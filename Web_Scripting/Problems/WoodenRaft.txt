Suppose you are stuck on a desert island. The only way to save yourself is to craft a wooden raft and go to the sea. Fortunately, you have a hand-made saw and a forest nearby. Moreover, you've already cut several trees and prepared it to the point that now you have n logs and the i-th log has length a_i.The wooden raft you'd like to build has the following structure: 2 logs of length x and x logs of length y. Such raft would have the area equal to x \cdot y. Both x and y must be integers since it's the only way you can measure the lengths while being on a desert island. And both x and y must be at least 2 since the raft that is one log wide is unstable.You can cut logs in pieces but you can't merge two logs in one. What is the maximum area of the raft you can craft?
