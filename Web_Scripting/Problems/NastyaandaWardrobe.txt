Nastya received a gift on New Year a magic wardrobe It is magic because in the end of each month the number of dresses in it doubles ie the number of dresses becomes twice as large as it is in the beginning of the monthUnfortunately right after the doubling the wardrobe eats one of the dresses if any with the 50 probability It happens every month except the last one in the year Nastya owns x dresses now so she became interested in the expected number of dresses she will have in one year Nastya lives in Byteland so the year lasts for k1 monthsNastya is really busy so she wants you to solve this problem You are the programmer after all Also you should find the answer modulo 1097 because it is easy to see that it is always integer
