You are given an integer n and an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. You should reorder the elements of the array a in such way that the sum of \textbf{MEX} on prefixes (i-th prefix is a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i) is maximized.Formally, you should find an array b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n, such that the sets of elements of arrays a and b are equal (it is equivalent to array b can be found as an array a with some reordering of its elements) and \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \textbf{MEX}(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_i) is maximized.\textbf{MEX} of a set of nonnegative integers is the minimal nonnegative integer such that it is not in the set.For example, \textbf{MEX}(\{1, 2, 3\}) = 0, \textbf{MEX}(\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5\}) = 3.
