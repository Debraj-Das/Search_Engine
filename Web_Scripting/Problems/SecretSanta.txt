Every December, VK traditionally holds an event for its employees named "Secret Santa". Here's how it happens.n employees numbered from 1 to n take part in the event. Each employee i is assigned a different employee b_i, to which employee i has to make a new year gift. Each employee is assigned to exactly one other employee, and nobody is assigned to themselves (but two employees may be assigned to each other). Formally, all b_i must be distinct integers between 1 and n, and for any i, b_i \ne i must hold.The assignment is usually generated randomly. This year, as an experiment, all event participants have been asked who they wish to make a gift to. Each employee i has said that they wish to make a gift to employee a_i.Find a valid assignment b that maximizes the number of fulfilled wishes of the employees.
