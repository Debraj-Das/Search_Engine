While discussing a proper problem A for a Codeforces Round, Kostya created a cyclic array of positive integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Since the talk was long and not promising, Kostya created a new cyclic array b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n} so that b_i = (a_i \mod a_{i + 1}), where we take a_{n+1} = a_1. Here mod is the modulo operation. When the talk became interesting, Kostya completely forgot how array a had looked like. Suddenly, he thought that restoring array a from array b would be an interesting problem (unfortunately, not A).
