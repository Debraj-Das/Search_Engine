There's a chip in the point (0, 0) of the coordinate plane. In one operation, you can move the chip from some point (x_1, y_1) to some point (x_2, y_2) if the Euclidean distance between these two points is an integer (i.e. \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2} is integer).Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the chip from the point (0, 0) to the point (x, y).
