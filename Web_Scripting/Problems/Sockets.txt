The ICM ACPC World Finals is coming Unfortunately the organizers of the competition were so busy preparing tasks that totally missed an important technical point  the organization of electricity supplement for all the participants workstationsThere are n computers for participants the ith of which has power equal to positive integer pi At the same time there are m sockets available the jth of which has power euqal to positive integer sj It is possible to connect the ith computer to the jth socket if and only if their powers are the same pisj It is allowed to connect no more than one computer to one socket Thus if the powers of all computers and sockets are distinct then no computer can be connected to any of the sockets In order to fix the situation professor Puch Williams urgently ordered a wagon of adapters power splitters Each adapter has one plug and one socket with a voltage divider between them After plugging an adapter to a socket with power x the power on the adapters socket becomes equal to  it means that it is equal to the sockets power divided by two with rounding up for example  and Each adapter can be used only once It is possible to connect several adapters in a chain plugging the first to a socket For example if two adapters are plugged one after enother to a socket with power 10 it becomes possible to connect one computer with power 3 to this socketThe organizers should install adapters so that it will be possible to supply with electricity the maximum number of computers c at the same time If there are several possible connection configurations they want to find the one that uses the minimum number of adapters u to connect c computersHelp organizers calculate the maximum number of connected computers c and the minimum number of adapters u needed for thisThe wagon of adapters contains enough of them to do the task It is guaranteed that its possible to connect at least one computer
