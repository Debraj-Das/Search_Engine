Consider a string s of n lowercase English letters. Let t_i be the string obtained by replacing the i-th character of s with an asterisk character *. For example, when s = \mathtt{abc}, we have t_1 = \tt{*bc}, t_2 = \tt{a*c}, and t_3 = \tt{ab*}.Given a string s, count the number of distinct strings of lowercase English letters and asterisks that occur as a substring of at least one string in the set \{s, t_1, \ldots, t_n \}. The empty string should be counted.Note that *'s are just characters and do not play any special role as in, for example, regex matching.
