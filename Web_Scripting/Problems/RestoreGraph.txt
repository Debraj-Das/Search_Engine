Valera had an undirected connected graph without self-loops and multiple edges consisting of n vertices. The graph had an interesting property: there were at most k edges adjacent to each of its vertices. For convenience, we will assume that the graph vertices were indexed by integers from 1 to n.One day Valera counted the shortest distances from one of the graph vertices to all other ones and wrote them out in array d. Thus, element d[i] of the array shows the shortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to vertex number i.Then something irreparable terrible happened. Valera lost the initial graph. However, he still has the array d. Help him restore the lost graph.
