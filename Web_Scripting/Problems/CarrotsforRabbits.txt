There are some rabbits in Singapore Zoo. To feed them, Zookeeper bought n carrots with lengths a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n. However, rabbits are very fertile and multiply very quickly. Zookeeper now has k rabbits and does not have enough carrots to feed all of them. To solve this problem, Zookeeper decided to cut the carrots into k pieces. For some reason, all resulting carrot lengths must be positive integers.Big carrots are very difficult for rabbits to handle and eat, so the time needed to eat a carrot of size x is x^2.Help Zookeeper split his carrots while minimizing the sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.
