You are given a board with n rows and n columns, numbered from 1 to n. The intersection of the a-th row and b-th column is denoted by (a, b).A half-queen attacks cells in the same row, same column, and on one diagonal. More formally, a half-queen on (a, b) attacks the cell (c, d) if a=c or b=d or a-b=c-d.  The blue cells are under attack.  What is the minimum number of half-queens that can be placed on that board so as to ensure that each square is attacked by at least one half-queen?Construct an optimal solution.
