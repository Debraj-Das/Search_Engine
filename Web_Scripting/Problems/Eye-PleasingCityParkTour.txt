There is a city park represented as a tree with n attractions as its vertices and n - 1 rails as its edges. The i-th attraction has happiness value a_i.Each rail has a color. It is either black if t_i = 0, or white if t_i = 1. Black trains only operate on a black rail track, and white trains only operate on a white rail track. If you are previously on a black train and want to ride a white train, or you are previously on a white train and want to ride a black train, you need to use 1 ticket.The path of a tour must be a simple path — it must not visit an attraction more than once. You do not need a ticket the first time you board a train. You only have k tickets, meaning you can only switch train types at most k times. In particular, you do not need a ticket to go through a path consisting of one rail color.Define f(u, v) as the sum of happiness values of the attractions in the tour (u, v), which is a simple path that starts at the u-th attraction and ends at the v-th attraction. Find the sum of f(u,v) for all valid tours (u, v) (1 \leq u \leq v \leq n) that does not need more than k tickets, modulo 10^9 + 7.
