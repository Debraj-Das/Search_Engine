Anfisa the monkey got disappointed in word processors as they arent good enough at reflecting all the range of her emotions thats why she decided to switch to graphics editors Having opened the BerPaint she saw a white rectangle WH in size which can be painted on First Anfisa learnt to navigate the drawing tool which is used to paint segments and quickly painted on that rectangle a certain number of blackcolored segments The resulting picture didnt seem bright enough to Anfisa thats why she turned her attention to the fill tool which is used to find a point on the rectangle to paint and choose a color after which all the area which is the same color as the point it contains is completely painted the chosen color Having applied the fill several times Anfisa expressed her emotions completely and stopped painting Your task is by the information on the painted segments and applied fills to find out for every color the total area of the areas painted this color after all the fills
