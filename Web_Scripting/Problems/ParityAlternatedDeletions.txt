Polycarp has an array a consisting of n integers.He wants to play a game with this array. The game consists of several moves. On the first move he chooses any element and deletes it (after the first move the array contains n-1 elements). For each of the next moves he chooses any element with the only restriction: its parity should differ from the parity of the element deleted on the previous move. In other words, he alternates parities (even-odd-even-odd-... or odd-even-odd-even-...) of the removed elements. Polycarp stops if he can't make a move.Formally:   If it is the first move, he chooses any element and deletes it;  If it is the second or any next move:   if the last deleted element was odd, Polycarp chooses any even element and deletes it;  if the last deleted element was even, Polycarp chooses any odd element and deletes it.   If after some move Polycarp cannot make a move, the game ends. Polycarp's goal is to minimize the sum of non-deleted elements of the array after end of the game. If Polycarp can delete the whole array, then the sum of non-deleted elements is zero.Help Polycarp find this value.
