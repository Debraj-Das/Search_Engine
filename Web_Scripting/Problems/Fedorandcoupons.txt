Also, for every integer there is a product with id equal to this integer. Fedor has n discount coupons, the i-th of them can be used with products with ids ranging from li to ri, inclusive. Today Fedor wants to take exactly k coupons with him.Fedor wants to choose the k coupons in such a way that the number of such products x that all coupons can be used with this product x is as large as possible (for better understanding, see examples). Fedor wants to save his time as well, so he asks you to choose coupons for him. Help Fedor!
