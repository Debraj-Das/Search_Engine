Xenia is a girl being born a noble. Due to the inflexibility and harshness of her family, Xenia has to find some ways to amuse herself. Recently Xenia has bought n_r red gems, n_g green gems and n_b blue gems. Each of the gems has a weight.Now, she is going to pick three gems.Xenia loves colorful things, so she will pick exactly one gem of each color.Xenia loves balance, so she will try to pick gems with little difference in weight.Specifically, supposing the weights of the picked gems are x, y and z, Xenia wants to find the minimum value of (x-y)^2+(y-z)^2+(z-x)^2. As her dear friend, can you help her?
