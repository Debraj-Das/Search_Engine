Petya got an array a of numbers from 1 to n, where a[i]=i.He performed n operations sequentially. In the end, he received a new state of the a array.At the i-th operation, Petya chose the first i elements of the array and cyclically shifted them to the right an arbitrary number of times (elements with indexes i+1 and more remain in their places). One cyclic shift to the right is such a transformation that the array a=[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] becomes equal to the array a = [a_i, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{i-2}, a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, \dots, a_n].For example, if a = [5,4,2,1,3] and i=3 (that is, this is the third operation), then as a result of this operation, he could get any of these three arrays:  a = [5,4,2,1,3] (makes 0 cyclic shifts, or any number that is divisible by 3);  a = [2,5,4,1,3] (makes 1 cyclic shift, or any number that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3);  a = [4,2,5,1,3] (makes 2 cyclic shifts, or any number that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3). Let's look at an example. Let n=6, i.e. initially a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]. A possible scenario is described below.  i=1: no matter how many cyclic shifts Petya makes, the array a does not change.  i=2: let's say Petya decided to make a 1 cyclic shift, then the array will look like a = [\textbf{2}, \textbf{1}, 3, 4, 5, 6].  i=3: let's say Petya decided to make 1 cyclic shift, then the array will look like a = [\textbf{3}, \textbf{2}, \textbf{1}, 4, 5, 6].  i=4: let's say Petya decided to make 2 cyclic shifts, the original array will look like a = [\textbf{1}, \textbf{4}, \textbf{3}, \textbf{2}, 5, 6].  i=5: let's say Petya decided to make 0 cyclic shifts, then the array won't change.  i=6: let's say Petya decided to make 4 cyclic shifts, the array will look like a = [\textbf{3}, \textbf{2}, \textbf{5}, \textbf{6}, \textbf{1}, \textbf{4}]. You are given a final array state a after all n operations. Determine if there is a way to perform the operation that produces this result. In this case, if an answer exists, print the numbers of cyclical shifts that occurred during each of the n operations.
