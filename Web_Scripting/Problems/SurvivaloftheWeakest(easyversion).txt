This is the easy version of the problem. It differs from the hard one only in constraints on n. You can make hacks only if you lock both versions.Let a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n be an array of non-negative integers. Let F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) be the sorted in the non-decreasing order array of n - 1 smallest numbers of the form a_i + a_j, where 1 \le i < j \le n. In other words, F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) is the sorted in the non-decreasing order array of n - 1 smallest sums of all possible pairs of elements of the array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. For example, F(1, 2, 5, 7) = [1 + 2, 1 + 5, 2 + 5] = [3, 6, 7].You are given an array of non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Determine the single element of the array \underbrace{F(F(F\ldots F}_{n-1}(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)\ldots)). Since the answer can be quite large, output it modulo 10^9+7.
