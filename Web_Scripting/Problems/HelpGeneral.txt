Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sir Lancelot the chief Royal General He was very proud of his men and he liked to invite the King to come and watch drill exercises which demonstrated the fighting techniques and tactics of the squad he was in charge of But time went by and one day Sir Lancelot had a major argument with the Fairy Godmother there were rumors that the argument occurred after the general spoke badly of the Godmothers flying techniques That seemed to hurt the Fairy Godmother very deeply As the result of the argument the Godmother put a rather strange curse upon the general It sounded all complicated and quite harmless If the squared distance between some two soldiers equals to 5 then those soldiers will conflict with each otherThe drill exercises are held on a rectangular nm field split into nm square 11 segments for each soldier Thus the square of the distance between the soldiers that stand on squares x1y1 and x2y2 equals exactly x1x22y1y22 Now not all nm squad soldiers can participate in the drill exercises as it was before the Fairy Godmothers curse Unless of course the general wants the soldiers to fight with each other or even worse For example if he puts a soldier in the square 22 then he cannot put soldiers in the squares 14 34 41 and 43  each of them will conflict with the soldier in the square 22Your task is to help the general You are given the size of the drill exercise field You are asked to calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be simultaneously positioned on this field so that no two soldiers fall under the Fairy Godmothers curse
