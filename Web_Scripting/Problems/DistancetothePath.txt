You are given a tree consisting of n vertices. Initially, each vertex has a value 0.You need to perform m queries of two types:   You are given a vertex index v. Print the value of the vertex v.  You are given two vertex indices u and v and values k and d (d \le 20). You need to add k to the value of each vertex such that the distance from that vertex to the path from u to v is less than or equal to d. The distance between two vertices x and y is equal to the number of edges on the path from x to y. For example, the distance from x to x itself is equal to 0.The distance from the vertex v to some path from x to y is equal to the minimum among distances from v to any vertex on the path from x to y.
