Limak is a big polar bear He prepared n problems for an algorithmic contest The ith problem has initial score pi Also testers said that it takes ti minutes to solve the ith problem Problems arent necessarily sorted by difficulty and maybe harder problems have smaller initial score but its too late to change it Limak has already announced initial scores for problems Though its still possible to adjust the speed of losing points denoted by c in this statementLet T denote the total number of minutes needed to solve all problems so Tt1t2tn The contest will last exactly T minutes So its just enough to solve all problemsPoints given for solving a problem decrease linearly Solving the ith problem after x minutes gives exactly  points where  is some real constant that Limak must chooseLets assume that c is fixed During a contest a participant chooses some order in which he or she solves problems There are n possible orders and each of them gives some total number of points not necessarily integer We say that an order is optimal if it gives the maximum number of points In other words the total number of points given by this order is greater or equal than the number of points given by any other order Its obvious that there is at least one optimal order However there may be more than one optimal orderLimak assumes that every participant will properly estimate ti at the very beginning and will choose some optimal order He also assumes that testers correctly predicted time needed to solve each problemFor two distinct problems i and j such that pipj Limak wouldnt be happy to see a participant with strictly more points for problem i than for problem j He calls such a situation a paradoxIts not hard to prove that there will be no paradox for c0 The situation may be worse for bigger c What is the maximum real value c remember that  for which there is no paradox possible that is there will be no paradox for any optimal order of solving problemsIt can be proved that the answer the maximum c as described always exists
