You are given a uppercase Latin letters 'A' and b letters 'B'.The period of the string is the smallest such positive integer k that s_i = s_{i~mod~k} (0-indexed) for each i. Note that this implies that k won't always divide a+b = |s|.For example, the period of string "ABAABAA" is 3, the period of "AAAA" is 1, and the period of "AABBB" is 5.Find the number of different periods over all possible strings with a letters 'A' and b letters 'B'.
