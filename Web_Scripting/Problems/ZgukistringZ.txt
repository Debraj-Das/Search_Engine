Professor GukiZ doesn't accept string as they are. He likes to swap some letters in string to obtain a new one.GukiZ has strings a, b, and c. He wants to obtain string k by swapping some letters in a, so that k should contain as many non-overlapping substrings equal either to b or c as possible. Substring of string x is a string formed by consecutive segment of characters from x. Two substrings of string x overlap if there is position i in string x occupied by both of them.GukiZ was disappointed because none of his students managed to solve the problem. Can you help them and find one of possible strings k?
