Ivan decided to prepare for the test on solving integer equations. He noticed that all tasks in the test have the following form:  You are given two positive integers u and v, find any pair of integers (not necessarily positive) x, y, such that: \frac{x}{u} + \frac{y}{v} = \frac{x + y}{u + v}.  The solution x = 0, y = 0 is forbidden, so you should find any solution with (x, y) \neq (0, 0). Please help Ivan to solve some equations of this form.
