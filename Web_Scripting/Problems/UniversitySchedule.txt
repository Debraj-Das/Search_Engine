In this problem your task is to come up with a week schedule of classes in university for professors and student groups Consider that there are 6 educational days in week and maximum number of classes per educational day is 7 classes numerated from 1 to 7 for each educational dayIt is known that in university n students study m professors work and there are a classrooms for conducting classes Also you have twodimensional array with nm size which contains the following information The number which stays in ith row and jth column equals to the number of classes which professor j must conduct with the group i in a single week The schedule which you output must satisfy to array described aboveThere are several other conditions for schedule Single professor can not conduct more than one class Similarly single student group can not be on more than one class at the same timeLet define a fatigue function for professors and student groups Call this function fTo single professor fatigue calculated in the following way Let look on classes which this professor must conduct in each of the 6th educational days Let x be the number of class which professor will firstly conduct in day i and let y  the last class for this professor Then the value 2yx12yx1 must be added to professors fatigue If professor has no classes in day i nothing is added to professors fatigue For single student group fatigue is calculated similarly Lets look at classes of this group in each of the 6 educational days Let x be the number of first class for this group on day i and let y  the last class for this group Then the value 2yx12yx1 must be added to this groups fatigue If student group has no classes in day i nothing is added to groups fatigueSo the value of function f equals to total fatigue for all n student groups and for all m professorsYour task is to come up with such a schedule which minimizes the value of function fJury prepared some solution of this problem For each test you will get a certain number of points It equals to result of division of the value of function f from the jury solution by the value of function f for schedule which your program output i e the smaller value of fatigue function your program find the more points you will get multiplied by 100 In the other words if the value of f for jury solution equals to p and for your solution  to q you will get 100pq points note that the number of points is a real number The points will be added together for all tests The goal is to score as many points as possible
