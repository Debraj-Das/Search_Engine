A boy named Leo doesnt miss a single TorCoder contest round On the last TorCoder round number 100666 Leo stumbled over the following problem He was given a string s consisting of n lowercase English letters and m queries Each query is characterised by a pair of integers liri 1lirin Well consider the letters in the string numbered from 1 to n from left to right that is ss1s2 sn After each query he must swap letters with indexes from li to ri inclusive in string s so as to make substring liri a palindrome If there are multiple such letter permutations you should choose the one where string liri will be lexicographically minimum If no such permutation exists you should ignore the query that is not change string sEverybody knows that on TorCoder rounds input line and array size limits never exceed 60 so Leo solved this problem easily Your task is to solve the problem on a little bit larger limits Given string s and m queries print the string that results after applying all m queries to string s
