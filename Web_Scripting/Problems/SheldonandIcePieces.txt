Do you remember how Kai constructed the word "eternity" using pieces of ice as components?Little Sheldon plays with pieces of ice, each piece has exactly one digit between 0 and 9. He wants to construct his favourite number t. He realized that digits 6 and 9 are very similar, so he can rotate piece of ice with 6 to use as 9 (and vice versa). Similary, 2 and 5 work the same. There is no other pair of digits with similar effect. He called this effect "Digital Mimicry".Sheldon favourite number is t. He wants to have as many instances of t as possible. How many instances he can construct using the given sequence of ice pieces. He can use any piece at most once.
