A widely known among some people Belarusian sport programmer Yura possesses lots of information about cars That is why he has been invited to participate in a game show called Guess That CarThe game show takes place on a giant parking lot which is 4n meters long from north to south and 4m meters wide from west to east The lot has n1 dividing lines drawn from west to east and m1 dividing lines drawn from north to south which divide the parking lot into nm 4 by 4 meter squares There is a car parked strictly inside each square The dividing lines are numbered from 0 to n from north to south and from 0 to m from west to east Each square has coordinates ij so that the square in the northwest corner has coordinates 11 and the square in the southeast corner has coordinates nm See the picture in the notes for clarificationsBefore the game show the organizers offer Yura to occupy any of the n1m1 intersection points of the dividing lines After that he can start guessing the cars After Yura chooses a point he will be prohibited to move along the parking lot before the end of the game show As Yura is a car expert he will always guess all cars he is offered its just a matter of time Yura knows that to guess each car he needs to spend time equal to the square of the euclidean distance between his point and the center of the square with this car multiplied by some coefficient characterizing the machines rarity the rarer the car is the harder it is to guess it More formally guessing a car with rarity c placed in a square whose center is at distance d from Yura takes cd2 seconds The time Yura spends on turning his head can be neglectedIt just so happened that Yura knows the rarity of each car on the parking lot in advance Help him choose his point so that the total time of guessing all cars is the smallest possible
