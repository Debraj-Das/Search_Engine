We have a secret array. You don't know this array and you have to restore it. However, you know some facts about this array:  The array consists of n distinct positive (greater than 0) integers.  The array contains two elements x and y (these elements are known for you) such that x < y.  If you sort the array in increasing order (such that a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n), differences between all adjacent (consecutive) elements are equal (i.e. a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2 = \ldots = a_n - a_{n-1}). It can be proven that such an array always exists under the constraints given below.Among all possible arrays that satisfy the given conditions, we ask you to restore one which has the minimum possible maximum element. In other words, you have to minimize \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n).You have to answer t independent test cases.
