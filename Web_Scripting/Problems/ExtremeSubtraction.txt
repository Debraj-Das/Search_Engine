You are given an array a of n positive integers.You can use the following operation as many times as you like: select any integer 1 \le k \le n and do one of two things:   decrement by one k of the first elements of the array.  decrement by one k of the last elements of the array. For example, if n=5 and a=[3,2,2,1,4], then you can apply one of the following operations to it (not all possible options are listed below):   decrement from the first two elements of the array. After this operation a=[2, 1, 2, 1, 4];  decrement from the last three elements of the array. After this operation a=[3, 2, 1, 0, 3];  decrement from the first five elements of the array. After this operation a=[2, 1, 1, 0, 3]; Determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero by applying a certain number of operations.
