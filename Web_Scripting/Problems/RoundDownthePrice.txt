At the store, the salespeople want to make all prices round. In this problem, a number that is a power of 10 is called a round number. For example, the numbers 10^0 = 1, 10^1 = 10, 10^2 = 100 are round numbers, but 20, 110 and 256 are not round numbers. So, if an item is worth m bourles (the value of the item is not greater than 10^9), the sellers want to change its value to the nearest round number that is not greater than m. They ask you: by how many bourles should you decrease the value of the item to make it worth exactly 10^k bourles, where the value of k — is the maximum possible (k — any non-negative integer).For example, let the item have a value of 178-bourles. Then the new price of the item will be 100, and the answer will be 178-100=78.
