You are given two multisets A and B Each multiset has exactly n integers each between 1 and n inclusive Multisets may contain multiple copies of the same numberYou would like to find a nonempty subset of A and a nonempty subset of B such that the sum of elements in these subsets are equal Subsets are also multisets ie they can contain elements with equal valuesIf no solution exists print 1 Otherwise print the indices of elements in any such subsets of A and B that have the same sum
