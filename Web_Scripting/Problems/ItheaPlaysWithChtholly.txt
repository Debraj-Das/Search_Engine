This is an interactive problem. Refer to the Interaction section below for better understanding.Ithea and Chtholly want to play a game in order to determine who can use the kitchen tonight.Initially, Ithea puts n clear sheets of paper in a line. They are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.This game will go on for m rounds. In each round, Ithea will give Chtholly an integer between 1 and c, and Chtholly needs to choose one of the sheets to write down this number (if there is already a number before, she will erase the original one and replace it with the new one).Chtholly wins if, at any time, all the sheets are filled with a number and the n numbers are in non-decreasing order looking from left to right from sheet 1 to sheet n, and if after m rounds she still doesn't win, she loses the game.Chtholly really wants to win the game as she wants to cook something for Willem. But she doesn't know how to win the game. So Chtholly finds you, and your task is to write a program to receive numbers that Ithea gives Chtholly and help her make the decision on which sheet of paper write this number.
