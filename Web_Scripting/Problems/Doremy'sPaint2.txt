Doremy has n buckets of paint which is represented by an array a of length n. Bucket i contains paint with color a_i. Initially, a_i=i.Doremy has m segments [l_i,r_i] (1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n). Each segment describes an operation. Operation i is performed as follows:   For each j such that l_i < j \leq r_i, set a_j := a_{l_i}. Doremy also selects an integer k. She wants to know for each integer x from 0 to m-1, the number of distinct colors in the array after performing operations x \bmod m +1, (x+1) \bmod m + 1, \ldots, (x+k-1) \bmod m +1. Can you help her calculate these values? Note that for each x individually we start from the initial array and perform only the given k operations in the given order.
