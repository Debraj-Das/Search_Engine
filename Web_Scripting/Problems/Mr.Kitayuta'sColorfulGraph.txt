Mr. Kitayuta has just bought an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. Each edge, namely edge i, has a color ci, connecting vertex ai and bi.Mr. Kitayuta wants you to process the following q queries.In the i-th query, he gives you two integers - ui and vi.Find the number of the colors that satisfy the following condition: the edges of that color connect vertex ui and vertex vi directly or indirectly.
