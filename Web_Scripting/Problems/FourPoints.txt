You are given four different integer points p_1, p_2, p_3 and p_4 on \mathit{XY} grid.In one step you can choose one of the points p_i and move it in one of four directions by one. In other words, if you have chosen point p_i = (x, y) you can move it to (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1), (x + 1, y) or (x - 1, y).Your goal to move points in such a way that they will form a square with sides parallel to \mathit{OX} and \mathit{OY} axes (a square with side 0 is allowed).What is the minimum number of steps you need to make such a square?
