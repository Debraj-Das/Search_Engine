Levenshtein distance between two strings of letters is calculated as the minimal total cost of a sequence of edit actions that converts one of the strings into the other one. The allowed edit actions are: substitution: the cost of substituting one letter with another is equal to the difference of index numbers of these letters in English alphabet. insertion/deletion: the cost of inserting a letter into a string or deleting a letter from a string is equal to the index number of this letter in English alphabet (see examples).You are given two strings. Find the Levenshtein distance between them.
