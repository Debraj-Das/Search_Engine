You are given an array a consisting of n integer numbers.Let instability of the array be the following value: \max\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{n} a_i.You have to remove exactly one element from this array to minimize instability of the resulting (n-1)-elements array. Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.
