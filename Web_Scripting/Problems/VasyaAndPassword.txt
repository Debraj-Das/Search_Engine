Vasya came up with a password to register for EatForces — a string s. The password in EatForces should be a string, consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits.But since EatForces takes care of the security of its users, user passwords must contain at least one digit, at least one uppercase Latin letter and at least one lowercase Latin letter. For example, the passwords "abaCABA12", "Z7q" and "3R24m" are valid, and the passwords "qwerty", "qwerty12345" and "Password" are not. A substring of string s is a string x = s_l s_{l + 1} \dots s_{l + len - 1} (1 \le l \le |s|, 0 \le len \le |s| - l + 1). len is the length of the substring. Note that the empty string is also considered a substring of s, it has the length 0.Vasya's password, however, may come too weak for the security settings of EatForces. He likes his password, so he wants to replace some its substring with another string of the same length in order to satisfy the above conditions. This operation should be performed exactly once, and the chosen string should have the minimal possible length.Note that the length of s should not change after the replacement of the substring, and the string itself should contain only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits.
