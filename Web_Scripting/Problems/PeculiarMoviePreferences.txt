Mihai plans to watch a movie. He only likes palindromic movies, so he wants to skip some (possibly zero) scenes to make the remaining parts of the movie palindromic.You are given a list s of n non-empty strings of length at most 3, representing the scenes of Mihai's movie.A subsequence of s is called awesome if it is non-empty and the concatenation of the strings in the subsequence, in order, is a palindrome.Can you help Mihai check if there is at least one awesome subsequence of s?A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, for example strings "z", "aaa", "aba", "abccba" are palindromes, but strings "codeforces", "reality", "ab" are not.A sequence a is a non-empty subsequence of a non-empty sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly zero, but not all) elements.
