Tokitsukaze has a sequence with length of n. She likes gems very much. There are n kinds of gems. The gems of the i-th kind are on the i-th position, and there are a_i gems of the same kind on that position. Define G(l,r) as the multiset containing all gems on the segment [l,r] (inclusive).A multiset of gems can be represented as S=[s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_n], which is a non-negative integer sequence of length n and means that S contains s_i gems of the i-th kind in the multiset. A multiset T=[t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n] is a multisubset of S=[s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_n] if and only if t_i\le s_i for any i satisfying 1\le i\le n.Now, given two positive integers k and p, you need to calculate the result of\sum_{l=1}^n \sum_{r=l}^n\sum\limits_{[t_1,t_2,\cdots,t_n] \subseteq G(l,r)}\left(\left(\sum_{i=1}^n p^{t_i}t_i^k\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^n[t_i>0]\right)\right),where [t_i>0]=1 if t_i>0 and [t_i>0]=0 if t_i=0.Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo 998\,244\,353.
