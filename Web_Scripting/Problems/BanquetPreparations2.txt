The chef has cooked n dishes yet again: the i-th dish consists of a_i grams of fish and b_i grams of meat. Banquet organizers consider two dishes i and j equal if a_i=a_j and b_i=b_j at the same time.The banquet organizers estimate the variety of n dishes as follows. The variety of a set of dishes is equal to the number of different dishes in it. The less variety is, the better.In order to reduce the variety, a taster was invited. He will eat exactly m_i grams of food from each dish. For each dish, the taster determines separately how much fish and how much meat he will eat. The only condition is that he will eat exactly m_i grams of the i-th dish in total.Determine how much of what type of food the taster should eat from each dish so that the value of variety is the minimum possible. If there are several correct answers, you may output any of them.
