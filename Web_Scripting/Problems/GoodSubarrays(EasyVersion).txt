This is the easy version of this problem. In this version, we do not have queries. Note that we have multiple test cases in this version. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.An array b of length m is good if for all i the i-th element is greater than or equal to i. In other words, b is good if and only if b_i \geq i for all i (1 \leq i \leq m).You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers. Find the number of pairs of indices (l, r), where 1 \le l \le r \le n, such that the array [a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r] is good.
