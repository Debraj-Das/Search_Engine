You are given an array s consisting of n integers.You have to find any array t of length k such that you can cut out maximum number of copies of array t from array s.Cutting out the copy of t means that for each element t_i of array t you have to find t_i in s and remove it from s. If for some t_i you cannot find such element in s, then you cannot cut out one more copy of t. The both arrays can contain duplicate elements.For example, if s = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1] and k = 3 then one of the possible answers is t = [1, 2, 3]. This array t can be cut out 2 times.   To cut out the first copy of t you can use the elements [1, \underline{\textbf{2}}, 3, 2, 4, \underline{\textbf{3}}, \underline{\textbf{1}}] (use the highlighted elements). After cutting out the first copy of t the array s can look like [1, 3, 2, 4].  To cut out the second copy of t you can use the elements [\underline{\textbf{1}}, \underline{\textbf{3}}, \underline{\textbf{2}}, 4]. After cutting out the second copy of t the array s will be [4]. Your task is to find such array t that you can cut out the copy of t from s maximum number of times. If there are multiple answers, you may choose any of them.
