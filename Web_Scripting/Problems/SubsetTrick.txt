Vanya invented an interesting trick with a set of integers.Let an illusionist have a set of positive integers S. He names a positive integer x. Then an audience volunteer must choose some subset (possibly, empty) of S without disclosing it to the illusionist. The volunteer tells the illusionist the size of the chosen subset. And here comes the trick: the illusionist guesses whether the sum of the subset elements does not exceed x. The sum of elements of an empty subset is considered to be 0.Vanya wants to prepare the trick for a public performance. He prepared some set of distinct positive integers S. Vasya wants the trick to be successful. He calls a positive number x unsuitable, if he can't be sure that the trick would be successful for every subset a viewer can choose.Vanya wants to count the number of unsuitable integers for the chosen set S.Vanya plans to try different sets S. He wants you to write a program that finds the number of unsuitable integers for the initial set S, and after each change to the set S. Vanya will make q changes to the set, and each change is one of the following two types:   add a new integer a to the set S, or  remove some integer a from the set S.
