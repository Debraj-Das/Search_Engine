On the competitive programming platform CodeCook, every person has a rating graph described by an array of integers a of length n. You are now updating the infrastructure, so you've created a program to compress these graphs.The program works as follows. Given an integer parameter k, the program takes the minimum of each contiguous subarray of length k in a.More formally, for an array a of length n and an integer k, define the k-compression array of a as an array b of length n-k+1, such that b_j =\min_{j\le i\le j+k-1}a_iFor example, the 3-compression array of [1, 3, 4, 5, 2] is [\min\{1, 3, 4\}, \min\{3, 4, 5\}, \min\{4, 5, 2\}]=[1, 3, 2].A permutation of length m is an array consisting of m distinct integers from 1 to m in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (m=3 but there is 4 in the array).A k-compression array will make CodeCook users happy if it will be a permutation. Given an array a, determine for all 1\leq k\leq n if CodeCook users will be happy after a k-compression of this array or not.
