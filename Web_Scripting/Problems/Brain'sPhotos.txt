Small but very brave mouse Brain was not accepted to summer school of young villains He was upset and decided to postpone his plans of taking over the world but to become a photographer insteadAs you may know the coolest photos are on the film because you can specify the hashtag film for suchBrain took a lot of colourful pictures on colored and blackandwhite film Then he developed and translated it into a digital form But now color and blackandwhite photos are in one folder and to sort them one needs to spend more than one hourAs soon as Brain is a photographer not programmer now he asks you to help him determine for a single photo whether it is colored or blackandwhitePhoto can be represented as a matrix sized nm and each element of the matrix stores a symbol indicating corresponding pixel color There are only 6 colors   C cyan M magenta Y yellow W white G grey B black The photo is considered blackandwhite if it has only white black and grey pixels in it If there are any of cyan magenta or yellow pixels in the photo then it is considered colored
