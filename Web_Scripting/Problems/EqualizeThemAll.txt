You are given an array a consisting of n integers. You can perform the following operations arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):  Choose a pair of indices (i, j) such that |i-j|=1 (indices i and j are adjacent) and set a_i := a_i + |a_i - a_j|;  Choose a pair of indices (i, j) such that |i-j|=1 (indices i and j are adjacent) and set a_i := a_i - |a_i - a_j|. The value |x| means the absolute value of x. For example, |4| = 4, |-3| = 3.Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to obtain the array of equal elements and print the order of operations to do it.It is guaranteed that you always can obtain the array of equal elements using such operations.Note that after each operation each element of the current array should not exceed 10^{18} by absolute value.
