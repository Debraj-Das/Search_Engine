This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is the constraint on n and the required number of operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.There are two binary strings a and b of length n (a binary string is a string consisting of symbols 0 and 1). In an operation, you select a prefix of a, and simultaneously invert the bits in the prefix (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0) and reverse the order of the bits in the prefix.For example, if a=001011 and you select the prefix of length 3, it becomes 011011. Then if you select the entire string, it becomes 001001.Your task is to transform the string a into b in at most 3n operations. It can be proved that it is always possible.
