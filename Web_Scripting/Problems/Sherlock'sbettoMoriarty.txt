Sherlock met Moriarty for a final battle of wits He gave him a regular n sided convex polygon In addition to it he gave him certain diagonals to form regions on the polygon It was guaranteed that the diagonals did not intersect in interior pointsHe took each of the region and calculated its importance value Importance value for a region formed by vertices a1a2 ax of the polygon will be given by 2a12a22ax Then he sorted these regions on the basis of their importance value in ascending order After that he assigned each region an index from 1 to k where k is the number of regions and index of region is its position in the sorted array calculated aboveHe wants Moriarty to color the regions using not more than 20 colors such that two regions have same color only if all the simple paths between these two regions have at least one region with color value less than the color value assigned to these regions Simple path between two regions f and h is a sequence of regions r1r2 rt such that r1f rth for each 1it regions ri and ri1 share an edge and rirj if and only if ijMoriarty couldnt answer and asks Sherlock to solve it himself Help Sherlock in doing so
