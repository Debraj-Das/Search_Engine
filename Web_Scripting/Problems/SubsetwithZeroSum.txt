You are given n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, such that for each 1\le i \le n holds i-n\le a_i\le i-1.Find some nonempty subset of these integers, whose sum is equal to 0. It can be shown that such a subset exists under given constraints. If there are several possible subsets with zero-sum, you can find any of them.
