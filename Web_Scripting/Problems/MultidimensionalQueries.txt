You are given an array a of n points in k-dimensional space. Let the distance between two points a_x and a_y be \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{k} |a_{x, i} - a_{y, i}| (it is also known as Manhattan distance).You have to process q queries of the following two types: 1 i b_1 b_2 ... b_k — set i-th element of a to the point (b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k); 2 l r — find the maximum distance between two points a_i and a_j, where l \le i, j \le r.
