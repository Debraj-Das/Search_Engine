Let's consider all integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive).Among all pairs of distinct integers in this range, find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of integers in pair. Formally, find the maximum value of \mathrm{gcd}(a, b), where 1 \leq a < b \leq n.The greatest common divisor, \mathrm{gcd}(a, b), of two positive integers a and b is the biggest integer that is a divisor of both a and b.
