As you know Vova has recently become a new shaman in the city of Ultima Thule So he has received the shaman knowledge about the correct bracket sequences The shamans of Ultima Thule have been using lots of different types of brackets since prehistoric times A bracket type is a positive integer The shamans define a correct bracket sequence as follows  An empty sequence is a correct bracket sequence  If a1a2al and b1b2bk are correct bracket sequences then sequence a1a2alb1b2bk their concatenation also is a correct bracket sequence  If a1a2al  is a correct bracket sequence then sequence  also is a correct bracket sequence where v v0 is an integer For example sequences 111221 and 33 are correct bracket sequences and 23 is notMoreover after Vova became a shaman he learned the most important correct bracket sequence x1x2xn consisting of n integers As sequence x is the most important Vova decided to encrypt it just in caseEncrypting consists of two sequences The first sequence p1p2pn contains types of brackets that is pixi 1in The second sequence q1q2qt contains t integers  some positions possibly not all of them which had negative numbers in sequence x1x2xnUnfortunately Vova forgot the main sequence But he was lucky enough to keep the encryption sequences p1p2pn and q1q2qt Help Vova restore sequence x by the encryption If there are multiple sequences that correspond to the encryption restore any of them If there are no such sequences you should tell so
