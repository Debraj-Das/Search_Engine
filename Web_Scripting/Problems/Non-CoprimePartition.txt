Find out if it is possible to partition the first n positive integers into two non-empty disjoint sets S_1 and S_2 such that:\mathrm{gcd}(\mathrm{sum}(S_1), \mathrm{sum}(S_2)) > 1 Here \mathrm{sum}(S) denotes the sum of all elements present in set S and \mathrm{gcd} means thegreatest common divisor.Every integer number from 1 to n should be present in exactly one of S_1 or S_2.
