On the board, Bob wrote n positive integers in base 10 with sum s (i. e. in decimal numeral system). Alice sees the board, but accidentally interprets the numbers on the board as base-11 integers and adds them up (in base 11).What numbers should Bob write on the board, so Alice's sum is as large as possible?
