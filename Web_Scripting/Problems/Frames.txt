One day Vasya got hold of a sheet of checkered paper nm squares in size Our Vasya adores geometrical figures so he painted two rectangles on the paper The rectangles sides are parallel to the coordinates axes also the length of each side of each rectangle is no less than 3 squares and the sides are painted by the grid lines The sides can also be part of the sheet of papers edge Then Vasya hatched all squares on the rectangles framesLets define a rectangles frame as the set of squares inside the rectangle that share at least one side with its borderA little later Vasya found a sheet of paper of exactly the same size and couldnt guess whether it is the same sheet of paper or a different one So he asked you to check whether the sheet of paper he had found contains two painted frames and nothing besides themPlease note that the frames painted by Vasya can arbitrarily intersect overlap or even completely coincideThe coordinates on the sheet of paper are introduced in such a way that the X axis goes from top to bottom the x coordinates of the squares numbers take values from 1 to n and the Y axis goes from the left to the right and the y coordinates of the squares numbers take values from 1 to m
