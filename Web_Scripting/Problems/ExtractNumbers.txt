You are given string s. Let's call word any largest sequence of consecutive symbols without symbols ',' (comma) and ';' (semicolon). For example, there are four words in string "aba,123;1a;0": "aba", "123", "1a", "0". A word can be empty: for example, the string s=";;" contains three empty words separated by ';'.You should find all words in the given string that are nonnegative INTEGER numbers without leading zeroes and build by them new string a. String a should contain all words that are numbers separating them by ',' (the order of numbers should remain the same as in the string s). By all other words you should build string b in the same way (the order of numbers should remain the same as in the string s).Here strings "101", "0" are INTEGER numbers, but "01" and "1.0" are not.For example, for the string aba,123;1a;0 the string a would be equal to "123,0" and string b would be equal to "aba,1a".
