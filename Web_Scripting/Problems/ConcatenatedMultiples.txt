You are given an array a, consisting of n positive integers.Let's call a concatenation of numbers x and y the number that is obtained by writing down numbers x and y one right after another without changing the order. For example, a concatenation of numbers 12 and 3456 is a number 123456.Count the number of ordered pairs of positions (i, j) (i \neq j) in array a such that the concatenation of a_i and a_j is divisible by k.
