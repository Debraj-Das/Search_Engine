Pak Chanek is participating in a lemper cooking competition. In the competition, Pak Chanek has to cook lempers with N stoves that are arranged sequentially from stove 1 to stove N. Initially, stove i has a temperature of A_i degrees. A stove can have a negative temperature.Pak Chanek realises that, in order for his lempers to be cooked, he needs to keep the temperature of each stove at a non-negative value. To make it happen, Pak Chanek can do zero or more operations. In one operation, Pak Chanek chooses one stove i with 2 \leq i \leq N-1, then:  changes the temperature of stove i-1 into A_{i-1} := A_{i-1} + A_{i},  changes the temperature of stove i+1 into A_{i+1} := A_{i+1} + A_{i}, and  changes the temperature of stove i into A_i := -A_i. Pak Chanek wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to do such that the temperatures of all stoves are at non-negative values. Help Pak Chanek by telling him the minimum number of operations needed or by reporting if it is not possible to do.
