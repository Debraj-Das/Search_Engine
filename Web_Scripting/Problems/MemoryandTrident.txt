Memory is performing a walk on the two-dimensional plane, starting at the origin. He is given a string s with his directions for motion: An 'L' indicates he should move one unit left.  An 'R' indicates he should move one unit right.  A 'U' indicates he should move one unit up.  A 'D' indicates he should move one unit down.But now Memory wants to end at the origin. To do this, he has a special trident. This trident can replace any character in s with any of 'L', 'R', 'U', or 'D'. However, because he doesn't want to wear out the trident, he wants to make the minimum number of edits possible. Please tell Memory what is the minimum number of changes he needs to make to produce a string that, when walked, will end at the origin, or if there is no such string.
