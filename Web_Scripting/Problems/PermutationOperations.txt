You are given a permutation a of size n and you should perform n operations on it. In the i-th operation, you can choose a non-empty suffix of a and increase all of its elements by i. How can we perform the operations to minimize the number of inversions in the final array?Note that you can perform operations on the same suffix any number of times you want.A permutation of size n is an array of size n such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this array. A suffix is several consecutive elements of an array that include the last element of the array. An inversion in an array a is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i > j and a_{i} < a_{j}.
