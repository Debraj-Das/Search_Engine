Roma (a popular Russian name that means 'Roman') loves the Little Lvov Elephant's lucky numbers.Let us remind you that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation only contains lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.Roma's got n positive integers. He wonders, how many of those integers have not more than k lucky digits?
