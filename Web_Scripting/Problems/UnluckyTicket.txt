Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets After a person buys a ticket which traditionally has an even number of digits he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second halfBut of course not every ticket can be lucky Far from it Moreover sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky So lets consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket Well say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons In other words there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second halfFor example ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky the sought correspondence is 21 and 42 ticket 0135 also meets the criterion the sought correspondence is 03 and 15 and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion You have a ticket in your hands it contains 2n digits Your task is to check whether it meets the unluckiness criterion
