A binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1. A bi-table is a table that has exactly two rows of equal length, each being a binary string.Let \operatorname{MEX} of a bi-table be the smallest digit among 0, 1, or 2 that does not occur in the bi-table. For example, \operatorname{MEX} for \begin{bmatrix} 0011\\ 1010 \end{bmatrix} is 2, because 0 and 1 occur in the bi-table at least once. \operatorname{MEX} for \begin{bmatrix} 111\\ 111 \end{bmatrix} is 0, because 0 and 2 do not occur in the bi-table, and 0 < 2.You are given a bi-table with n columns. You should cut it into any number of bi-tables (each consisting of consecutive columns) so that each column is in exactly one bi-table. It is possible to cut the bi-table into a single bi-table — the whole bi-table.What is the maximal sum of \operatorname{MEX} of all resulting bi-tables can be?
