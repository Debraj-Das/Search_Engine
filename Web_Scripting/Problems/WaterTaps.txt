Consider a system of n water taps all pouring water into the same container. The i-th water tap can be set to deliver any amount of water from 0 to ai ml per second (this amount may be a real number). The water delivered by i-th tap has temperature ti.If for every  you set i-th tap to deliver exactly xi ml of water per second, then the resulting temperature of water will be  (if , then to avoid division by zero we state that the resulting water temperature is 0).You have to set all the water taps in such a way that the resulting temperature is exactly T. What is the maximum amount of water you may get per second if its temperature has to be T?
