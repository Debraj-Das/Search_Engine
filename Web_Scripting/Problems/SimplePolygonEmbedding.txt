The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C2. The only difference is that, in problem C1, n is always even, and in C2, n is always odd.You are given a regular polygon with 2 \cdot n vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length 1. Let's name it as 2n-gon.Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed 2n-gon in the square. Embedding 2n-gon in the square means that you need to place 2n-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of 2n-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square.You can rotate 2n-gon and/or the square.
