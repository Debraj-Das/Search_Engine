Student Dima from Kremland has a matrix a of size n \times m filled with non-negative integers.He wants to select exactly one integer from each row of the matrix so that the bitwise exclusive OR of the selected integers is strictly greater than zero. Help him!Formally, he wants to choose an integers sequence c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n (1 \leq c_j \leq m) so that the inequality a_{1, c_1} \oplus a_{2, c_2} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{n, c_n} > 0 holds, where a_{i, j} is the matrix element from the i-th row and the j-th column.Here x \oplus y denotes the bitwise XOR operation of integers x and y.
