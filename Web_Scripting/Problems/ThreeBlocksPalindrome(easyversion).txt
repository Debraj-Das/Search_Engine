The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.You are given a sequence a consisting of n positive integers.Let's define a three blocks palindrome as the sequence, consisting of at most two distinct elements (let these elements are a and b, a can be equal b) and is as follows: [\underbrace{a, a, \dots, a}_{x}, \underbrace{b, b, \dots, b}_{y}, \underbrace{a, a, \dots, a}_{x}]. There x, y are integers greater than or equal to 0. For example, sequences [], [2], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 2, 1] and [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] are three block palindromes but [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] and [1, 2] are not.Your task is to choose the maximum by length subsequence of a that is a three blocks palindrome.You have to answer t independent test cases.Recall that the sequence t is a a subsequence of the sequence s if t can be derived from s by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if s=[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1], then possible subsequences are: [1, 1, 1, 1], [3] and [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1], but not [3, 2, 3] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 2].
