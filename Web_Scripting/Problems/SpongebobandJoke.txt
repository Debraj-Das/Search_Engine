While Patrick was gone shopping Spongebob decided to play a little trick on his friend The naughty Sponge browsed through Patricks personal stuff and found a sequence a1a2am of length m consisting of integers from 1 to n not necessarily distinct Then he picked some sequence f1f2fn of length n and for each number ai got number bifai To finish the prank he erased the initial sequence aiIts hard to express how sad Patrick was when he returned home from shopping We will just say that Spongebob immediately got really sorry about what he has done and he is now trying to restore the original sequence Help him do this or determine that this is impossible
