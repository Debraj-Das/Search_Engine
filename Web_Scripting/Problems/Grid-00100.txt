A mad scientist Dr.Jubal has made a competitive programming task. Try to solve it!You are given integers n,k. Construct a grid A with size n \times n consisting of integers 0 and 1. The very important condition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly k. In other words, the number of 1 in the grid is equal to k.Let's define:  A_{i,j} as the integer in the i-th row and the j-th column.  R_i = A_{i,1}+A_{i,2}+...+A_{i,n} (for all 1 \le i \le n).  C_j = A_{1,j}+A_{2,j}+...+A_{n,j} (for all 1 \le j \le n).  In other words, R_i are row sums and C_j are column sums of the grid A.  For the grid A let's define the value f(A) = (\max(R)-\min(R))^2 + (\max(C)-\min(C))^2 (here for an integer sequence X we define \max(X) as the maximum value in X and \min(X) as the minimum value in X). Find any grid A, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids find any, for which the value f(A) is the minimum possible. Among such tables, you can find any.
