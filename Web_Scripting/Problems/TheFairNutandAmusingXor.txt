The Fair Nut has two arrays a and b, consisting of n numbers. He found them so long ago that no one knows when they came to him.The Fair Nut often changes numbers in his arrays. He also is interested in how similar a and b are after every modification.Let's denote similarity of two arrays as the minimum number of operations to apply to make arrays equal (every operation can be applied for both arrays). If it is impossible, similarity will be equal -1.Per one operation you can choose a subarray with length k (k is fixed), and change every element a_i, which belongs to the chosen subarray, to a_i \oplus x (x can be chosen), where \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Nut has already calculated the similarity of the arrays after every modification. Can you do it?Note that you just need to calculate those values, that is you do not need to apply any operations.
