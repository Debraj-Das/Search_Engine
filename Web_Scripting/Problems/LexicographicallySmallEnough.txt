You are given two strings s and t of equal length n. In one move, you can swap any two adjacent characters of the string s.You need to find the minimal number of operations you need to make string s lexicographically smaller than string t.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:   a is a prefix of b, but a \ne b;  in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
