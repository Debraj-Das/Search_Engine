You are given two integers a and b. In one turn, you can do one of the following operations:   Take an integer c (c > 1 and a should be divisible by c) and replace a with \frac{a}{c};  Take an integer c (c > 1 and b should be divisible by c) and replace b with \frac{b}{c}. Your goal is to make a equal to b using exactly k turns.For example, the numbers a=36 and b=48 can be made equal in 4 moves:   c=6, divide b by c \Rightarrow a=36, b=8;  c=2, divide a by c \Rightarrow a=18, b=8;  c=9, divide a by c \Rightarrow a=2, b=8;  c=4, divide b by c \Rightarrow a=2, b=2. For the given numbers a and b, determine whether it is possible to make them equal using exactly k turns.
