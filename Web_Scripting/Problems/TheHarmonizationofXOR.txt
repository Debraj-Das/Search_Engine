You are given an array of exactly n numbers [1,2,3,\ldots,n] along with integers k and x.Partition the array in exactly k non-empty disjoint subsequences such that the bitwise XOR of all numbers in each subsequence is x, and each number is in exactly one subsequence. Notice that there are no constraints on the length of each subsequence.A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.For example, for n = 15, k = 6, x = 7, the following scheme is valid:   [6,10,11], 6 \oplus 10 \oplus 11 = 7,  [5,12,14], 5 \oplus 12 \oplus 14 = 7,  [3,9,13], 3 \oplus 9 \oplus 13 = 7,  [1,2,4], 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 7,  [8,15], 8 \oplus 15 = 7,  [7], 7 = 7,  where \oplus represents the bitwise XOR operation.The following scheme is invalid, since 8, 15 do not appear:   [6,10,11], 6 \oplus 10 \oplus 11 = 7,  [5,12,14], 5 \oplus 12 \oplus 14 = 7,  [3,9,13], 3 \oplus 9 \oplus 13 = 7,  [1,2,4], 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 7,  [7], 7 = 7. The following scheme is invalid, since 3 appears twice, and 1, 2 do not appear:   [6,10,11], 6 \oplus 10 \oplus 11 = 7,  [5,12,14], 5 \oplus 12 \oplus 14 = 7,  [3,9,13], 3 \oplus 9 \oplus 13 = 7,  [3,4], 3 \oplus 4 = 7,  [8,15], 8 \oplus 15 = 7,  [7], 7 = 7.
