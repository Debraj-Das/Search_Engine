The Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for 130 years. Who ever proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to this problem:Given a number m, how many polynomials P with coefficients in set {\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}} have: P(2)=m?Help Jerry Mao solve the long standing problem!
