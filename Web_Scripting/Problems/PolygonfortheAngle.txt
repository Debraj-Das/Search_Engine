You are given an angle \text{ang}. The Jury asks You to find such regular n-gon (regular polygon with n vertices) that it has three vertices a, b and c (they can be non-consecutive) with \angle{abc} = \text{ang} or report that there is no such n-gon.  If there are several answers, print the minimal one. It is guarantied that if answer exists then it doesn't exceed 998244353.
