Vova has won n trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.
