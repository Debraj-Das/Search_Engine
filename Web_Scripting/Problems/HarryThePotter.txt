To defeat Lord Voldemort, Harry needs to destroy all horcruxes first. The last horcrux is an array a of n integers, which also needs to be destroyed. The array is considered destroyed if all its elements are zeroes. To destroy the array, Harry can perform two types of operations:  choose an index i (1 \le i \le n), an integer x, and subtract x from a_i. choose two indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le n; i \ne j), an integer x, and subtract x from a_i and x + 1 from a_j. Note that x does not have to be positive.Harry is in a hurry, please help him to find the minimum number of operations required to destroy the array and exterminate Lord Voldemort.
