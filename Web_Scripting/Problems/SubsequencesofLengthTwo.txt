You are given two strings s and t consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of t is 2 (i.e. this string consists only of two characters).In one move, you can choose any character of s and replace it with any lowercase Latin letter. More formally, you choose some i and replace s_i (the character at the position i) with some character from 'a' to 'z'.You want to do no more than k replacements in such a way that maximizes the number of occurrences of t in s as a subsequence.Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
