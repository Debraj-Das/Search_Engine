There are n cities in Berland. Some pairs of cities are connected by roads. All roads are bidirectional. Each road connects two different cities. There is at most one road between a pair of cities. The cities are numbered from 1 to n.It is known that, from the capital (the city with the number 1), you can reach any other city by moving along the roads.The President of Berland plans to improve the country's road network. The budget is enough to repair exactly n-1 roads. The President plans to choose a set of n-1 roads such that:  it is possible to travel from the capital to any other city along the n-1 chosen roads,  if d_i is the number of roads needed to travel from the capital to city i, moving only along the n-1 chosen roads, then d_1 + d_2 + \dots + d_n is minimized (i.e. as minimal as possible). In other words, the set of n-1 roads should preserve the connectivity of the country, and the sum of distances from city 1 to all cities should be minimized (where you can only use the n-1 chosen roads).The president instructed the ministry to prepare k possible options to choose n-1 roads so that both conditions above are met.Write a program that will find k possible ways to choose roads for repair. If there are fewer than k ways, then the program should output all possible valid ways to choose roads.
