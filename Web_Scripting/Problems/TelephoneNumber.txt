A telephone number is a sequence of exactly 11 digits, where the first digit is 8. For example, the sequence 80011223388 is a telephone number, but the sequences 70011223388 and 80000011223388 are not.You are given a string s of length n, consisting of digits.In one operation you can delete any character from string s. For example, it is possible to obtain strings 112, 111 or 121 from string 1121.You need to determine whether there is such a sequence of operations (possibly empty), after which the string s becomes a telephone number.
