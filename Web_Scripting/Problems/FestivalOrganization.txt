The Prodiggers are quite a cool band and for this reason they have been the surprise guest at the ENTER festival for the past 80 years At the beginning of their careers they werent so successful so they had to spend time digging channels to earn money hence the name Anyway they like to tour a lot and have surprising amounts of energy to do extremely long tours However they hate spending two consecutive days without having a concert so they would like to avoid itA tour is defined by a sequence of concerts and daysoff You need to count in how many ways The Prodiggers can select k different tours of the same length between l and rFor example if k2 l1 and r2 if we define concert day as 1 and dayoff as 0 here are all possible tours 0 1 00 01 10 11 But tour 00 can not be selected because it has 2 daysoff in a row Now we need to count in how many ways we can select k2 tours of the same length in range 12 Here they are 01 0110 0111 1011Since their schedule is quite busy they want you to tell them in how many ways can do that modulo 1000000007 1097
