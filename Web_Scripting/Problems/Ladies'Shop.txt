A ladies shop has recently opened in the city of Ultima Thule To get ready for the opening the shop bought n bags Each bag is characterised by the total weight ai of the items you can put there The weird thing is you cannot use these bags to put a set of items with the total weight strictly less than ai However the weights of the items that will be sold in the shop havent yet been defined Thats what you should determine right nowYour task is to find the set of the items weights p1p2pk 1p1p2pk such that  Any bag will be used That is for any i 1in there will be such set of items that their total weight will equal ai We assume that there is the infinite number of items of any weight You can put multiple items of the same weight in one bag  For any set of items that have total weight less than or equal to m there is a bag into which you can put this set Similarly a set of items can contain multiple items of the same weight  Of all sets of the items weights that satisfy points 1 and 2 find the set with the minimum number of weights In other words value k should be as small as possible Find and print the required set
