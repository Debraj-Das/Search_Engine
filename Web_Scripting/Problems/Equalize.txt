You are given two binary strings a and b of the same length. You can perform the following two operations on the string a:  Swap any two bits at indices i and j respectively (1 \le i, j \le n), the cost of this operation is |i - j|, that is, the absolute difference between i and j.  Select any arbitrary index i (1 \le i \le n) and flip (change 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) the bit at this index. The cost of this operation is 1. Find the minimum cost to make the string a equal to b. It is not allowed to modify string b.
