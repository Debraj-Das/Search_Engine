Ilya estimated the usefulness of the i-th tasks as r_{i} and divided the tasks into three topics, the topic of the i-th task is type_{i}.Anton wants to solve exactly a tasks on the first topic, b tasks on the second topic and c tasks on the third topic. Tell Anton if it is possible to do so, and if it is, calculate the maximum total usefulness of the tasks he may solve.
