This is an interactive problem. Remember to flush your output while communicating with the testing program. You may use fflush(stdout) in C++, system.out.flush() in Java, stdout.flush() in Python or flush(output) in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307.The jury guessed some array a consisting of 6 integers. There are 6 special numbers — 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 — and each of these numbers occurs in a exactly once (so, a is some permutation of these numbers).You don't know anything about their order, but you are allowed to ask up to 4 queries. In each query, you may choose two indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le 6, i and j are not necessarily distinct), and you will get the value of a_i \cdot a_j in return.Can you guess the array a?The array a is fixed beforehand in each test, the interaction program doesn't try to adapt to your queries.
