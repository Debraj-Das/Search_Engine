Santa Claus has Robot which lives on the infinite grid and can move along its lines He can also having a sequence of m points p1p2pm with integer coordinates do the following denote its initial location by p0 First the robot will move from p0 to p1 along one of the shortest paths between them please notice that since the robot moves only along the grid lines there can be several shortest paths Then after it reaches p1 itll move to p2 again choosing one of the shortest ways then to p3 and so on until he has visited all points in the given order Some of the points in the sequence may coincide in that case Robot will visit that point several times according to the sequence orderWhile Santa was away someone gave a sequence of points to Robot This sequence is now lost but Robot saved the protocol of its unit movements Please find the minimum possible length of the sequence
