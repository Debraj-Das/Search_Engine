In the autumn of this year two Russian teams came into the group stage of the most prestigious football club competition in the world  the UEFA Champions League Now these teams have already started to play in the group stage and are fighting for advancing to the playoffs In this problem we are interested in the draw stage the process of sorting teams into groupsThe process of the draw goes as follows the rules that are described in this problem are somehow simplified compared to the real life Suppose n teams will take part in the group stage n is divisible by four The teams should be divided into groups of four Lets denote the number of groups as m  Each team has a rating  an integer characterizing the teams previous achievements The teams are sorted by the ratings decreasing no two teams have the same ratingAfter that four baskets are formed each of which will contain m teams the first m teams with the highest rating go to the first basket the following m teams go to the second one and so onThen the following procedure repeats m1 times A team is randomly taken from each basket first from the first basket then from the second then from the third and at last from the fourth The taken teams form another group After that they are removed from their basketsThe four teams remaining in the baskets after m1 such procedures are performed form the last groupIn the real draw the random selection of teams from the basket is performed by people  as a rule the wellknown players of the past As we have none we will use a random number generator which is constructed as follows Its parameters are four positive integers xabc Every time there is a call to the random number generator it produces the following actions  calculates   replaces parameter x by value y assigns   returns x as another random number Operation  means taking the remainder after division  A random number generator will be used in the draw as follows each time we need to randomly choose a team from the basket it will generate a random number k The teams that yet remain in the basket are considered numbered with consecutive integers from 0 to s1 in the order of decreasing rating where s is the current size of the basket Then a team number  is taken from the basketGiven a list of teams and the parameters of the random number generator determine the result of the draw
