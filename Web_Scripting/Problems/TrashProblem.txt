Vova decided to clean his room. The room can be represented as the coordinate axis OX. There are n piles of trash in the room, coordinate of the i-th pile is the integer p_i. All piles have different coordinates.Let's define a total cleanup as the following process. The goal of this process is to collect all the piles in no more than two different x coordinates. To achieve this goal, Vova can do several (possibly, zero) moves. During one move, he can choose some x and move all piles from x to x+1 or x-1 using his broom. Note that he can't choose how many piles he will move.Also, there are two types of queries:  0 x — remove a pile of trash from the coordinate x. It is guaranteed that there is a pile in the coordinate x at this moment.  1 x — add a pile of trash to the coordinate x. It is guaranteed that there is no pile in the coordinate x at this moment. Note that it is possible that there are zero piles of trash in the room at some moment.Vova wants to know the minimum number of moves he can spend if he wants to do a total cleanup before any queries. He also wants to know this number of moves after applying each query. Queries are applied in the given order. Note that the total cleanup doesn't actually happen and doesn't change the state of piles. It is only used to calculate the number of moves.For better understanding, please read the Notes section below to see an explanation for the first example.
