Running with barriers on the circle track is very popular in the country where Dasha lives so no wonder that on her way to classes she saw the following situationThe track is the circle with length L in distinct points of which there are n barriers Athlete always run the track in counterclockwise direction if you look on him from above All barriers are located at integer distance from each other along the track Her friends the parrot Kefa and the leopard Sasha participated in competitions and each of them ran one lap Each of the friends started from some integral point on the track Both friends wrote the distance from their start along the track to each of the n barriers Thus each of them wrote n integers in the ascending order each of them was between 0 and L1 inclusively  Consider an example Let L8 blue points are barriers and green points are Kefas start A and Sashas start B Then Kefa writes down the sequence 246 and Sasha writes down 157 There are several tracks in the country all of them have same length and same number of barriers but the positions of the barriers can differ among different tracks Now Dasha is interested if it is possible that Kefa and Sasha ran the same track or they participated on different tracks Write the program which will check that Kefas and Sashas tracks coincide it means that one can be obtained from the other by changing the start position Note that they always run the track in one direction  counterclockwise if you look on a track from above
