A subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.A palindromic sequence is a sequence that is equal to the reverse of itself.You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Any integer value appears in a no more than twice.What is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of sequence a?
