Thumbelina has had an accident. She has found herself on a little island in the middle of a swamp and wants to get to the shore very much.One can get to the shore only by hills that are situated along a straight line that connects the little island with the shore. Let us assume that the hills are numbered from 1 to n and the number of a hill is equal to the distance in meters between it and the island. The distance between the n-th hill and the shore is also 1 meter.Thumbelina is too small to make such jumps. Fortunately, a family of frogs living in the swamp suggests to help her. Each frog agrees to give Thumbelina a ride but Thumbelina should choose only one frog. Each frog has a certain jump length. If Thumbelina agrees to accept help from a frog whose jump length is d, the frog will jump from the island on the hill d, then — on the hill 2d, then 3d and so on until they get to the shore (i.e. find itself beyond the hill n).However, there is one more problem: mosquitoes also live in the swamp. At the moment they have a siesta, and they are having a nap on some hills. If the frog jumps on a hill with a mosquito the frog will smash it. The frogs Thumbelina has met are pacifists, so they will find the death of each mosquito very much sad. Help Thumbelina choose a frog that will bring her to the shore and smash as small number of mosquitoes as possible.
