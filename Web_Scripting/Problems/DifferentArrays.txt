You are given an array a consisting of n integers.You have to perform the sequence of n-2 operations on this array:  during the first operation, you either add a_2 to a_1 and subtract a_2 from a_3, or add a_2 to a_3 and subtract a_2 from a_1;  during the second operation, you either add a_3 to a_2 and subtract a_3 from a_4, or add a_3 to a_4 and subtract a_3 from a_2;  ...  during the last operation, you either add a_{n-1} to a_{n-2} and subtract a_{n-1} from a_n, or add a_{n-1} to a_n and subtract a_{n-1} from a_{n-2}. So, during the i-th operation, you add the value of a_{i+1} to one of its neighbors, and subtract it from the other neighbor.For example, if you have the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], one of the possible sequences of operations is:  subtract 2 from a_3 and add it to a_1, so the array becomes [3, 2, 1, 4, 5];  subtract 1 from a_2 and add it to a_4, so the array becomes [3, 1, 1, 5, 5];  subtract 5 from a_3 and add it to a_5, so the array becomes [3, 1, -4, 5, 10]. So, the resulting array is [3, 1, -4, 5, 10].An array is reachable if it can be obtained by performing the aforementioned sequence of operations on a. You have to calculate the number of reachable arrays, and print it modulo 998244353.
