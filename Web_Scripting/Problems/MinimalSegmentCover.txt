You are given n intervals in form [l; r] on a number line.You are also given m queries in form [x; y]. What is the minimal number of intervals you have to take so that every point (not necessarily integer) from x to y is covered by at least one of them? If you can't choose intervals so that every point from x to y is covered, then print -1 for that query.
