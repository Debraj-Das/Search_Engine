Little D is a friend of Little C who loves intervals very much instead of number "3".Now he has n intervals on the number axis, the i-th of which is [a_i,b_i].Only the n intervals can not satisfy him. He defines the value of an interval of intervals [l,r] (1 \leq l \leq r \leq n, l and r are both integers) as the total length of the union of intervals from the l-th to the r-th.He wants to select exactly k different intervals of intervals such that the sum of their values is maximal. Please help him calculate the maximal sum.
