Ayoub had an array a of integers of size n and this array had two interesting properties:   All the integers in the array were between l and r (inclusive).  The sum of all the elements was divisible by 3. Unfortunately, Ayoub has lost his array, but he remembers the size of the array n and the numbers l and r, so he asked you to find the number of ways to restore the array. Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7 (i.e. the remainder when dividing by 10^9 + 7). In case there are no satisfying arrays (Ayoub has a wrong memory), print 0.
