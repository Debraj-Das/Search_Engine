Mayor of city S just hates trees and lawns They take so much space and there could be a road on the place they occupyThe Mayor thinks that one of the main city streets could be considerably widened on account of lawn nobody needs anyway Moreover that might help reduce the car jams which happen from time to time on the streetThe street is split into n equal length parts from left to right the ith part is characterized by two integers width of road si and width of lawn gi  For each of n parts the Mayor should decide the size of lawn to demolish For the ith part he can reduce lawn width by integer xi 0xigi After it new road width of the ith part will be equal to sisixi and new lawn width will be equal to gigixiOn the one hand the Mayor wants to demolish as much lawn as possible and replace it with road On the other hand he does not want to create a rapid widening or narrowing of the road which would lead to car accidents To avoid that the Mayor decided that width of the road for consecutive parts should differ by at most 1 ie for each i 1in the inequation si1si1 should hold Initially this condition might not be trueYou need to find the the total width of lawns the Mayor will destroy according to his plan
