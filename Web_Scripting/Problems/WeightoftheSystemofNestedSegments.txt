On the number line there are m points, i-th of which has integer coordinate x_i and integer weight w_i. The coordinates of all points are different, and the points are numbered from 1 to m.A sequence of n segments [l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \dots, [l_n, r_n] is called system of nested segments if for each pair i, j (1 \le i < j \le n) the condition l_i < l_j < r_j < r_i is satisfied. In other words, the second segment is strictly inside the first one, the third segment is strictly inside the second one, and so on.For a given number n, find a system of nested segments such that:  both ends of each segment are one of m given points;  the sum of the weights 2\cdot n of the points used as ends of the segments is minimal. For example, let m = 8. The given points are marked in the picture, their weights are marked in red, their coordinates are marked in blue. Make a system of three nested segments:  weight of the first segment: 1 + 1 = 2  weight of the second segment: 10 + (-1) = 9  weight of the third segment: 3 + (-2) = 1  sum of the weights of all the segments in the system: 2 + 9 + 1 = 12   System of three nested segments
