Eshag has an array a consisting of n integers.Eshag can perform the following operation any number of times: choose some subsequence of a and delete every element from it which is strictly larger than AVG, where AVG is the average of the numbers in the chosen subsequence.For example, if a = [1 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 4] and Eshag applies the operation to the subsequence containing a_1, a_2, a_4 and a_5, then he will delete those of these 4 elements which are larger than \frac{a_1+a_2+a_4+a_5}{4} = \frac{11}{4}, so after the operation, the array a will become a = [1 , 3 , 2].Your task is to find the maximum number of elements Eshag can delete from the array a by applying the operation described above some number (maybe, zero) times.A sequence b is a subsequence of an array c if b can be obtained from c by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
