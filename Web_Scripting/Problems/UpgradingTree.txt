You are given a tree with n vertices and you are allowed to perform no more than 2n transformations on it Transformation is defined by three vertices xyy and consists of deleting edge xy and adding edge xy Transformation xyy could be performed if all the following conditions are satisfied  There is an edge xy in the current tree  After the transformation the graph remains a tree  After the deletion of edge xy the tree would consist of two connected components Lets denote the set of nodes in the component containing vertex x by Vx and the set of nodes in the component containing vertex y by Vy Then condition VxVy should be satisfied ie the size of the component with x should be strictly larger than the size of the component with y You should minimize the sum of squared distances between all pairs of vertices in a tree which you could get after no more than 2n transformations and output any sequence of transformations leading initial tree to such stateNote that you dont need to minimize the number of operations It is necessary to minimize only the sum of the squared distances
