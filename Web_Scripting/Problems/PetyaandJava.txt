Little Petya has recently started attending a programming club Naturally he is facing the problem of choosing a programming language After long considerations he realized that Java is the best choice The main argument in favor of choosing Java was that it has a very large integer data type called BigIntegerBut having attended several classes of the club Petya realized that not all tasks require using the BigInteger type It turned out that in some tasks it is much easier to use small data types Thats why a question arises Which integer type to use if one wants to store a positive integer nPetya knows only 5 integer types1 byte occupies 1 byte and allows you to store numbers from 128 to 1272 short occupies 2 bytes and allows you to store numbers from 32768 to 327673 int occupies 4 bytes and allows you to store numbers from 2147483648 to 21474836474 long occupies 8 bytes and allows you to store numbers from 9223372036854775808 to 92233720368547758075 BigInteger can store any integer number but at that it is not a primitive type and operations with it are much slowerFor all the types given above the boundary values are included in the value rangeFrom this list Petya wants to choose the smallest type that can store a positive integer n Since BigInteger works much slower Peter regards it last Help him
