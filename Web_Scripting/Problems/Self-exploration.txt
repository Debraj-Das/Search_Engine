Being bored of exploring the Moon over and over again Wall-B decided to explore something he is made of — binary numbers. He took a binary number and decided to count how many times different substrings of length two appeared. He stored those values in c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10} and c_{11}, representing how many times substrings 00, 01, 10 and 11 appear in the number respectively. For example: 10111100 \rightarrow c_{00} = 1, \ c_{01} = 1,\ c_{10} = 2,\ c_{11} = 3 10000 \rightarrow c_{00} = 3,\ c_{01} = 0,\ c_{10} = 1,\ c_{11} = 0 10101001 \rightarrow c_{00} = 1,\ c_{01} = 3,\ c_{10} = 3,\ c_{11} = 0 1 \rightarrow c_{00} = 0,\ c_{01} = 0,\ c_{10} = 0,\ c_{11} = 0Wall-B noticed that there can be multiple binary numbers satisfying the same c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{10} and c_{11} constraints. Because of that he wanted to count how many binary numbers satisfy the constraints c_{xy} given the interval [A, B]. Unfortunately, his processing power wasn't strong enough to handle large intervals he was curious about. Can you help him? Since this number can be large print it modulo 10^9 + 7.
