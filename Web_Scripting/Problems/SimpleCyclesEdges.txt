You are given an undirected graph, consisting of n vertices and m edges. The graph does not necessarily connected. Guaranteed, that the graph does not contain multiple edges (more than one edges between a pair of vertices) or loops (edges from a vertex to itself).A cycle in a graph is called a simple, if it contains each own vertex exactly once. So simple cycle doesn't allow to visit a vertex more than once in a cycle.Determine the edges, which belong to exactly on one simple cycle.
