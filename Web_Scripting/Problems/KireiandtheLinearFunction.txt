Given the string s of decimal digits (0-9) of length n.A substring is a sequence of consecutive characters of a string. The substring of this string is defined by a pair of indexes — with its left and right ends. So, each pair of indexes (l, r), where 1 \le l \le r \le n, corresponds to a substring of the string s. We will define as v(l,r) the numeric value of the corresponding substring (leading zeros are allowed in it).For example, if n=7, s="1003004", then v(1,3)=100, v(2,3)=0 and v(2,7)=3004.You are given n, s and an integer w (1 \le w < n).You need to process m queries, each of which is characterized by 3 numbers l_i, r_i, k_i (1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n; 0 \le k_i \le 8).The answer to the ith query is such a pair of substrings of length w that if we denote them as (L_1, L_1+w-1) and (L_2, L_2+w-1), then:  L_1 \ne L_2, that is, the substrings are different;  the remainder of dividing a number v(L_1, L_1+w-1) \cdot v(l_i, r_i) + v(L_2, L_2 + w - 1) by 9 is equal to k_i. If there are many matching substring pairs, then find a pair where L_1 is as small as possible. If there are many matching pairs in this case, then minimize L_2.Note that the answer may not exist.
