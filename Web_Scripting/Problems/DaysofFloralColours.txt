The Floral Clock has been standing by the side of Mirror Lake for years Though unable to keep time it reminds people of the passage of time and the good old daysOn the rim of the Floral Clock are 2n flowers numbered from 1 to 2n clockwise each of which has a colour among all n possible ones For each colour there are exactly two flowers with it the distance between which either is less than or equal to 2 or equals n Additionally if flowers u and v are of the same colour then flowers opposite to u and opposite to v should be of the same colour as well  symmetry is beautifulFormally the distance between two flowers is 1 plus the number of flowers on the minor arc or semicircle between them Below is a possible arrangement with n6 that cover all possibilities  The beauty of an arrangement is defined to be the product of the lengths of flower segments separated by all opposite flowers of the same colour In other words in order to compute the beauty we remove from the circle all flowers that have the same colour as flowers opposite to them Then the beauty is the product of lengths of all remaining segments Note that we include segments of length 0 in this product If there are no flowers that have the same colour as flower opposite to them the beauty equals 0 For instance the beauty of the above arrangement equals 13139  the segments are 2 456 8 and 101112While keeping the constraints satisfied there may be lots of different arrangements Find out the sum of beauty over all possible arrangements modulo 998244353 Two arrangements are considered different if a pair uv 1uv2n exists such that flowers u and v are of the same colour in one of them but not in the other
