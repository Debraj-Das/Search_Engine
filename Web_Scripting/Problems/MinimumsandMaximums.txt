An array is beautiful if both of the following two conditions meet:  there are at least l_1 and at most r_1 elements in the array equal to its minimum;  there are at least l_2 and at most r_2 elements in the array equal to its maximum. For example, the array [2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 3, 2] has 3 elements equal to its minimum (1-st, 3-rd and 7-th) and 2 elements equal to its maximum (4-th and 5-th).Another example: the array [42, 42, 42] has 3 elements equal to its minimum and 3 elements equal to its maximum.Your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of elements in a beautiful array.
