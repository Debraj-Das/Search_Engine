In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.A permutation p of size n is given. A permutation of size n is an array of size n in which each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once. For example, [1, 4, 3, 2] and [4, 2, 1, 3] are correct permutations while [1, 2, 4] and [1, 2, 2] are not.Let us consider an empty deque (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [1, 5, 2] currently in the deque, adding an element 4 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\color{red}{4}, 1, 5, 2], and adding same element to the end will produce [1, 5, 2, \color{red}{4}].The elements of the permutation are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with p_1 and finishing with p_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or the end.For example, if we consider a permutation p = [3, 1, 2, 4], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this: \quad 1.add 3 to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence [\color{red}{3}] in it;\quad 2.add 1 to the beginning of the deque:deque has a sequence [\color{red}{1}, 3] in it;\quad 3.add 2 to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence [1, 3, \color{red}{2}] in it;\quad 4.add 4 to the end of the deque:deque has a sequence [1, 3, 2, \color{red}{4}] in it;Find the lexicographically smallest possible sequence of elements in the deque after the entire permutation has been processed. A sequence [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n] is lexicographically smaller than the sequence [y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n] if there exists such i \leq n that x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, \ldots, x_{i - 1} = y_{i - 1} and x_i < y_i. In other words, if the sequences x and y have some (possibly empty) matching prefix, and the next element of the sequence x is strictly smaller than the corresponding element of the sequence y. For example, the sequence [1, 3, 2, 4] is smaller than the sequence [1, 3, 4, 2] because after the two matching elements [1, 3] in the start the first sequence has an element 2 which is smaller than the corresponding element 4 in the second sequence.
