Gerald bought two very rare paintings at the Sothebys auction and he now wants to hang them on the wall For that he bought a special board to attach it to the wall and place the paintings on the board The board has shape of an a1b1 rectangle the paintings have shape of a a2b2 and a3b3 rectanglesSince the paintings are painted in the style of abstract art it does not matter exactly how they will be rotated but still one side of both the board and each of the paintings must be parallel to the floor The paintings can touch each other and the edges of the board but can not overlap or go beyond the edge of the board Gerald asks whether it is possible to place the paintings on the board or is the board he bought not large enough
