Dasha decided to have a rest after solving the problem She had been ready to start her favourite activity  origami but remembered the puzzle that she could not solve   The tree is a nonoriented connected graph without cycles In particular there always are n1 edges in a tree with n verticesThe puzzle is to position the vertices at the points of the Cartesian plane with integral coordinates so that the segments between the vertices connected by edges are parallel to the coordinate axes Also the intersection of segments is allowed only at their ends Distinct vertices should be placed at different points Help Dasha to find any suitable way to position the tree vertices on the planeIt is guaranteed that if it is possible to position the tree vertices on the plane without violating the condition which is given above then you can do it by using points with integral coordinates which dont exceed 1018 in absolute value
