You are given a positive integer k and an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of non-negative distinct integers not smaller than k and not greater than 2^c-1.In each of the next k seconds, one element is chosen randomly equiprobably out of all n elements and decreased by 1.For each integer x, 0 \leq x \leq 2^c - 1, you need to find the probability that in the end the bitwise XOR of all elements of the array is equal to x. Each of these values can be represented as an irreducible fraction \frac{p}{q}, and you need to find the value of p \cdot q^{-1} modulo 998\,244\,353.
