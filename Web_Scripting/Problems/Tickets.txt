As a big fan of Formula One Charlie is really happy with the fact that he has to organize ticket sells for the next Grand Prix race in his own city Unfortunately the finacial crisis is striking everywhere and all the banknotes left in his country are valued either 10 euros or 20 euros The price of all tickets for the race is 10 euros so whenever someone comes to the ticket store only with 20 euro banknote Charlie must have a 10 euro banknote to give them change Charlie realize that with the huge deficit of banknotes this could be a problem Charlie has some priceless information but couldnt make use of it so he needs your help Exactly nm people will come to buy a ticket n of them will have only a single 10 euro banknote and m of them will have only a single 20 euro banknote Currently Charlie has k 10 euro banknotes which he can use for change if needed All nm people will come to the ticket store in random order all orders are equiprobable Return the probability that the ticket selling process will run smoothly ie Charlie will have change for every person with 20 euro banknote
