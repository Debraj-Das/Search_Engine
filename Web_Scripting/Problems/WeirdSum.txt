Egor has a table of size n \times m, with lines numbered from 1 to n and columns numbered from 1 to m. Each cell has a color that can be presented as an integer from 1 to 10^5.Let us denote the cell that lies in the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column as (r, c). We define the manhattan distance between two cells (r_1, c_1) and (r_2, c_2) as the length of a shortest path between them where each consecutive cells in the path must have a common side. The path can go through cells of any color. For example, in the table 3 \times 4 the manhattan distance between (1, 2) and (3, 3) is 3, one of the shortest paths is the following: (1, 2) \to (2, 2) \to (2, 3) \to (3, 3). Egor decided to calculate the sum of manhattan distances between each pair of cells of the same color. Help him to calculate this sum.
