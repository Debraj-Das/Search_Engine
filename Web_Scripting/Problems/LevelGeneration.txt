Ivan is developing his own computer game Now he tries to create some levels for his game But firstly for each level he needs to draw a graph representing the structure of the levelIvan decided that there should be exactly ni vertices in the graph representing level i and the edges have to be bidirectional When constructing the graph Ivan is interested in special edges called bridges An edge between two vertices u and v is called a bridge if this edge belongs to every path between u and v and these vertices will belong to different connected components if we delete this edge For each level Ivan wants to construct a graph where at least half of the edges are bridges He also wants to maximize the number of edges in each constructed graphSo the task Ivan gave you is given q numbers n1n2nq for each i tell the maximum number of edges in a graph with ni vertices if at least half of the edges are bridges Note that the graphs cannot contain multiple edges or selfloops
