Oleg the bank client checks share prices every day. There are n share prices he is interested in. Today he observed that each second exactly one of these prices decreases by k rubles (note that each second exactly one price changes, but at different seconds different prices can change). Prices can become negative. Oleg found this process interesting, and he asked Igor the financial analyst, what is the minimum time needed for all n prices to become equal, or it is impossible at all? Igor is busy right now, so he asked you to help Oleg. Can you answer this question?
