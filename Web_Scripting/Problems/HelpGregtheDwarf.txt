A very unusual citizen lives in a far away kingdom  Dwarf Gracula However his unusual name is not the weirdest thing besides everyone long ago got used to calling him simply Dwarf Greg What is special about Dwarf Greg  hes been living for over 200 years besides he lives in a crypt on an abandoned cemetery and nobody has ever seen him out in daytime Moreover nobody has ever seen Greg buy himself any food Thats why nobody got particularly surprised when after the infernal dragons tragic death cattle continued to disappear from fields The people in the neighborhood were long sure that the harmless dragon was never responsible for disappearing cattle considering that the dragon used to be sincere about his vegetarian views But even thats not the worst part of the whole storyThe worst part is that merely several minutes ago Dwarf Greg in some unintelligible way got inside your house and asked you to help him solve a problem The point is that a short time ago Greg decided to order a new coffin knowing his peculiar character you are not surprised at all But the problem is a very long in both directions Lshaped corridor leads to Gregs crypt and you cant drag just any coffin through that corridor Thats why he asked you to help  Youve formalized the task on a plane like this let the corridors width before and after the turn be equal to a and b correspondingly see the picture The corridor turns directly at a right angle the coffin is a rectangle whose length and width are equal to l and w lw correspondingly Dwarf Greg has already determined the coffins length l which is based on his height your task is to determine the coffins maximally possible width w at which it can be brought to the crypt Besides due to its large mass pure marble the coffin is equipped with rotating wheels therefore it is impossible to lift it off the ground however arbitrary moves and rotations of the coffin in the plane become possible The coffin may be rotated arbitrarily just before you drag it into crypt and move through the corridorGreg promised that if you help him he will grant you immortality I wonder how And if you dont well trust me you dont want to know what happens if you dont help him
