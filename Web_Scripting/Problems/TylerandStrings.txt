While looking at the kitchen fridge, the little boy Tyler noticed magnets with symbols, that can be aligned into a string s.Tyler likes strings, and especially those that are lexicographically smaller than another string, t. After playing with magnets on the fridge, he is wondering, how many distinct strings can be composed out of letters of string s by rearranging them, so that the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the string t? Tyler is too young, so he can't answer this question. The alphabet Tyler uses is very large, so for your convenience he has already replaced the same letters in s and t to the same integers, keeping that different letters have been replaced to different integers.We call a string x lexicographically smaller than a string y if one of the followings conditions is fulfilled:   There exists such position of symbol m that is presented in both strings, so that before m-th symbol the strings are equal, and the m-th symbol of string x is smaller than m-th symbol of string y.  String x is the prefix of string y and x \neq y. Because the answer can be too large, print it modulo 998\,244\,353.
