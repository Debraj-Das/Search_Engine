Luckily, Serval got onto the right bus, and he came to the kindergarten on time. After coming to kindergarten, he found the toy bricks very funny.He has a special interest to create difficult problems for others to solve. This time, with many 1 \times 1 \times 1 toy bricks, he builds up a 3-dimensional object. We can describe this object with a n \times m matrix, such that in each cell (i,j), there are h_{i,j} bricks standing on the top of each other.However, Serval doesn't give you any h_{i,j}, and just give you the front view, left view, and the top view of this object, and he is now asking you to restore the object. Note that in the front view, there are m columns, and in the i-th of them, the height is the maximum of h_{1,i},h_{2,i},\dots,h_{n,i}. It is similar for the left view, where there are n columns. And in the top view, there is an n \times m matrix t_{i,j}, where t_{i,j} is 0 or 1. If t_{i,j} equals 1, that means h_{i,j}>0, otherwise, h_{i,j}=0.However, Serval is very lonely because others are bored about his unsolvable problems before, and refused to solve this one, although this time he promises there will be at least one object satisfying all the views. As his best friend, can you have a try?
