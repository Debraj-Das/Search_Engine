Once upon a time in the galaxy of far far awayDarth Wader found out the location of a rebels base Now he is going to destroy the base and the whole planet that the base is located at using the Death StarWhen the rebels learnt that the Death Star was coming they decided to use their new secret weapon  space mines Lets describe a space mines buildEach space mine is shaped like a ball well call it the mine body of a certain radius r with the center in the point O Several spikes protrude from the center Each spike can be represented as a segment connecting the center of the mine with some point P such that  transporting longspiked mines is problematic where OP is the length of the segment connecting O and P It is convenient to describe the point P by a vector p such that POpThe Death Star is shaped like a ball with the radius of R R exceeds any mines radius It moves at a constant speed along the v vector at the speed equal to v At the moment the rebels noticed the Star of Death it was located in the point AThe rebels located n space mines along the Death Stars way You may regard the mines as being idle The Death Star does not know about the mines existence and cannot notice them which is why it doesnt change the direction of its movement As soon as the Star of Death touched the mine its body or one of the spikes the mine bursts and destroys the Star of Death A touching is the situation when there is a point in space which belongs both to the mine and to the Death Star It is considered that Death Star will not be destroyed if it can move infinitely long time without touching the minesHelp the rebels determine whether they will succeed in destroying the Death Star using space mines or not If they will succeed determine the moment of time when it will happen starting from the moment the Death Star was noticed
