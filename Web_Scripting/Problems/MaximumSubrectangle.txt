You are given two arrays a and b of positive integers, with length n and m respectively. Let c be an n \times m matrix, where c_{i,j} = a_i \cdot b_j. You need to find a subrectangle of the matrix c such that the sum of its elements is at most x, and its area (the total number of elements) is the largest possible.Formally, you need to find the largest number s such that it is possible to choose integers x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 subject to 1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq n, 1 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq m, (x_2 - x_1 + 1) \times (y_2 - y_1 + 1) = s, and \sum_{i=x_1}^{x_2}{\sum_{j=y_1}^{y_2}{c_{i,j}}} \leq x.
