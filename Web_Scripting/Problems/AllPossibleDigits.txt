A positive number x of length n in base p (2 \le p \le 10^9) is written on the blackboard. The number x is given as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i < p) — the digits of x in order from left to right (most significant to least significant).Dmitry is very fond of all the digits of this number system, so he wants to see each of them at least once.In one operation, he can:   take any number x written on the board, increase it by 1, and write the new value x + 1 on the board. For example, p=5 and x=234_5.  Initially, the board contains the digits 2, 3 and 4;  Dmitry increases the number 234_5 by 1 and writes down the number 240_5. On the board there are digits 0, 2, 3, 4;  Dmitry increases the number 240_5 by 1 and writes down the number 241_5. Now the board contains all the digits from 0 to 4. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all the digits from 0 to p-1 appear on the board at least once.
