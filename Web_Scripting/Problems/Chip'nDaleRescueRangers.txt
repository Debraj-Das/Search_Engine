A team of furry rescue rangers was sitting idle in their hollow tree when suddenly they received a signal of distress In a few moments they were ready and the dirigible of the rescue chipmunks hit the roadWe assume that the action takes place on a Cartesian plane The headquarters of the rescuers is located at point x1y1 and the distress signal came from the point x2y2Due to Gadgets engineering talent the rescuers dirigible can instantly change its current velocity and direction of movement at any moment and as many times as needed The only limitation is the speed of the aircraft relative to the air can not exceed  meters per secondOf course Gadget is a true rescuer and wants to reach the destination as soon as possible The matter is complicated by the fact that the wind is blowing in the air and it affects the movement of the dirigible According to the weather forecast the wind will be defined by the vector vxvy for the nearest t seconds and then will change to wxwy These vectors give both the direction and velocity of the wind Formally if a dirigible is located at the point xy while its own velocity relative to the air is equal to zero and the wind uxuy is blowing then after  seconds the new position of the dirigible will be Gadget is busy piloting the aircraft so she asked Chip to calculate how long will it take them to reach the destination if they fly optimally He coped with the task easily but Dale is convinced that Chip has given the random value aiming only not to lose the face in front of Gadget Dale has asked you to find the right answerIt is guaranteed that the speed of the wind at any moment of time is strictly less than the maximum possible speed of the airship relative to the air
