Polycarp takes part in a quadcopter competition According to the rules a flying robot should  start the race from some point of a field  go around the flag  close cycle returning back to the starting point Polycarp knows the coordinates of the starting point x1y1 and the coordinates of the point where the flag is situated x2y2 Polycarps quadcopter can fly only parallel to the sides of the field each tick changing exactly one coordinate by 1 It means that in one tick the quadcopter can fly from the point xy to any of four points x1y x1y xy1 or xy1Thus the quadcopter path is a closed cycle starting and finishing in x1y1 and containing the point x2y2 strictly inside  The picture corresponds to the first example the starting and finishing point is in 15 and the flag is in 52 What is the minimal length of the quadcopter path
