In Pavlopolis University where Noora studies it was decided to hold beauty contest Miss Pavlopolis University Lets describe the process of choosing the most beautiful girl in the university in more detailThe contest is held in several stages Suppose that exactly n girls participate in the competition initially All the participants are divided into equal groups x participants in each group Furthermore the number x is chosen arbitrarily i e on every stage number x can be different Within each group the jury of the contest compares beauty of the girls in the format each with each In this way if group consists of x girls then  comparisons occur Then from each group the most beautiful participant is selected Selected girls enter the next stage of the competition Thus if n girls were divided into groups x participants in each group then exactly  participants will enter the next stage The contest continues until there is exactly one girl left who will be Miss Pavlopolis UniversityBut for the jury this contest is a very tedious task They would like to divide the girls into groups in each stage so that the total number of pairwise comparisons of the girls is as few as possible Let fn be the minimal total number of comparisons that should be made to select the most beautiful participant if we admit n girls to the first stageThe organizers of the competition are insane They give Noora three integers t l and r and ask the poor girl to calculate the value of the following expression t0flt1fl1trlfr However since the value of this expression can be quite large the organizers ask her to calculate it modulo 1097 If Noora can calculate the value of this expression the organizers promise her to help during the beauty contest But the poor girl is not strong in mathematics so she turned for help to Leha and he turned to you
