LuoTianyi is watching the anime Made in Abyss. She finds that making a Cartridge is interesting. To describe the process of making a Cartridge more clearly, she abstracts the original problem and gives you the following problem.You are given a tree T consisting of n vertices. Each vertex has values a_i and b_i and each edge has values c_j and d_j.Now you are aim to build a tree T' as follows:  First, select p vertices from T (p is a number chosen by yourself) as the vertex set S' of T'.  Next, select p-1 edges from T one by one (you cannot select one edge more than once).  May you have chosen the j-th edge connects vertices x_j and y_j with values (c_j,d_j), then you can choose two vertices u and v in S' that satisfy the edge (x_j,y_j) is contained in the simple path from u to v in T, and link u and v in T' by the edge with values (c_j,d_j) (u and v shouldn't be contained in one connected component before in T').   A tree with three vertices, \min(A,C)=1,B+D=7, the cost is 7.   Selected vertices 2 and 3 as S', used the edge (1,2) with c_j = 2 and d_j = 1 to link this vertices, now \min(A,C)=2,B+D=4, the cost is 8. Let A be the minimum of values a_i in T' and C be the minimum of values c_i in T'. Let B be the sum of b_i in T' and D be the sum of values d_i in T'. Let \min(A, C) \cdot (B + D) be the cost of T'. You need to find the maximum possible cost of T'.
