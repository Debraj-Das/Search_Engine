The Fair Nut got stacked in planar world. He should solve this task to get out.You are given n rectangles with vertexes in (0, 0), (x_i, 0), (x_i, y_i), (0, y_i). For each rectangle, you are also given a number a_i. Choose some of them that the area of union minus sum of a_i of the chosen ones is maximum.It is guaranteed that there are no nested rectangles.Nut has no idea how to find the answer, so he asked for your help.
