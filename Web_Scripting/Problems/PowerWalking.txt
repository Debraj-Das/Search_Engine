A child's strength is equal to the number of different types among power-ups he has.For a team of size k, Sam will distribute all n power-ups to k children in such a way that each of the k children receives at least one power-up, and each power-up is given to someone.For each integer k from 1 to n, find the minimum sum of strengths of a team of k children Sam can get.
