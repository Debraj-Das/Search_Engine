You are given an array of n integers. You need to split all integers into two groups so that the GCD of all integers in the first group is equal to one and the GCD of all integers in the second group is equal to one.The GCD of a group of integers is the largest non-negative integer that divides all the integers in the group.Both groups have to be non-empty.
