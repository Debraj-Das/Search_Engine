You are given a positive integer n.The weight of a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n is the number of indices 1\le i\le n such that i divides p_i. Find a permutation p_1,p_2,\dots, p_n with the minimum possible weight (among all permutations of length n).A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
