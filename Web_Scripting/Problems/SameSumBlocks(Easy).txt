This problem is given in two editions, which differ exclusively in the constraints on the number n.You are given an array of integers a[1], a[2], \dots, a[n]. A block is a sequence of contiguous (consecutive) elements a[l], a[l+1], \dots, a[r] (1 \le l \le r \le n). Thus, a block is defined by a pair of indices (l, r).Find a set of blocks (l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \dots, (l_k, r_k) such that:  They do not intersect (i.e. they are disjoint). Formally, for each pair of blocks (l_i, r_i) and (l_j, r_j) where i \neq j either r_i < l_j or r_j < l_i.  For each block the sum of its elements is the same. Formally, a[l_1]+a[l_1+1]+\dots+a[r_1]=a[l_2]+a[l_2+1]+\dots+a[r_2]= \dots = a[l_k]+a[l_k+1]+\dots+a[r_k].  The number of the blocks in the set is maximum. Formally, there does not exist a set of blocks (l_1', r_1'), (l_2', r_2'), \dots, (l_{k'}', r_{k'}') satisfying the above two requirements with k' > k.   The picture corresponds to the first example. Blue boxes illustrate blocks. Write a program to find such a set of blocks.
