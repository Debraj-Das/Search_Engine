You are given a checkerboard of size 201 \times 201, i. e. it has 201 rows and 201 columns. The rows of this checkerboard are numbered from -100 to 100 from bottom to top. The columns of this checkerboard are numbered from -100 to 100 from left to right. The notation (r, c) denotes the cell located in the r-th row and the c-th column.There is a king piece at position (0, 0) and it wants to get to position (a, b) as soon as possible. In this problem our king is lame. Each second, the king makes exactly one of the following five moves.   Skip move. King's position remains unchanged.  Go up. If the current position of the king is (r, c) he goes to position (r + 1, c).  Go down. Position changes from (r, c) to (r - 1, c).  Go right. Position changes from (r, c) to (r, c + 1).  Go left. Position changes from (r, c) to (r, c - 1).  King is not allowed to make moves that put him outside of the board. The important consequence of the king being lame is that he is not allowed to make the same move during two consecutive seconds. For example, if the king goes right, the next second he can only skip, go up, down, or left.What is the minimum number of seconds the lame king needs to reach position (a, b)?
