You are given a strictly convex polygon with n vertices.You will make k cuts that meet the following conditions:   each cut is a segment that connects two different nonadjacent vertices;  two cuts can intersect only at vertices of the polygon. Your task is to maximize the area of the smallest region that will be formed by the polygon and those k cuts.
