Today the «Z» city residents enjoy a shell game competition. The residents are gathered on the main square to watch the breath-taking performance. The performer puts 3 non-transparent cups upside down in a row. Then he openly puts a small ball under one of the cups and starts to shuffle the cups around very quickly so that on the whole he makes exactly 3 shuffles. After that the spectators have exactly one attempt to guess in which cup they think the ball is and if the answer is correct they get a prize. Maybe you can try to find the ball too?
