Vasya will fancy any number as long as it is an integer power of two. Petya, on the other hand, is very conservative and only likes a single integer p (which may be positive, negative, or zero). To combine their tastes, they invented p-binary numbers of the form 2^x + p, where x is a non-negative integer.For example, some -9-binary ("minus nine" binary) numbers are: -8 (minus eight), 7 and 1015 (-8=2^0-9, 7=2^4-9, 1015=2^{10}-9).The boys now use p-binary numbers to represent everything. They now face a problem: given a positive integer n, what's the smallest number of p-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) they need to represent n as their sum? It may be possible that representation is impossible altogether. Help them solve this problem.For example, if p=0 we can represent 7 as 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2.And if p=-9 we can represent 7 as one number (2^4-9).Note that negative p-binary numbers are allowed to be in the sum (see the Notes section for an example).
