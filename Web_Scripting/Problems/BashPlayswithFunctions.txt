Bash got tired on his journey to become the greatest Pokemon master So he decides to take a break and play with functionsBash defines a function f0n which denotes the number of ways of factoring n into two factors p and q such that gcdpq1 In other words f0n is the number of ordered pairs of positive integers pq such that pqn and gcdpq1But Bash felt that it was too easy to calculate this function So he defined a series of functions where fr1 is defined asWhere uv is any ordered pair of positive integers they need not to be coprimeNow Bash wants to know the value of frn for different r and n Since the value could be huge he would like to know the value modulo 1097 Help him
