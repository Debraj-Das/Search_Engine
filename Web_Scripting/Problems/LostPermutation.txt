A sequence of n numbers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the sequences [3, 1, 4, 2], [1] and [2,1] are permutations, but [1,2,1], [0,1] and [1,3,4] — are not.Polycarp lost his favorite permutation and found only some of its elements — the numbers b_1, b_2, \dots b_m. He is sure that the sum of the lost elements equals s.Determine whether one or more numbers can be appended to the given sequence b_1, b_2, \dots b_m such that the sum of the added numbers equals s, and the resulting new array is a permutation?
