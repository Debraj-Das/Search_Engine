Vasya plays a computer game with ninjas At this stage Vasyas ninja should get out of a deep canyonThe canyon consists of two vertical parallel walls their height is n meters Lets imagine that we split these walls into 1 meterlong areas and number them with positive integers from 1 to n from bottom to top Some areas are safe and the ninja can climb them Others are spiky and ninja cant be there Lets call such areas dangerousInitially the ninja is on the lower area of the left wall He can use each second to perform one of the following actions   climb one area up  climb one area down  jump to the opposite wall That gets the ninja to the area that is exactly k meters higher than the area he jumped from More formally if before the jump the ninja is located at area x of one wall then after the jump he is located at area xk of the other wall If at some point of time the ninja tries to get to an area with a number larger than n then we can assume that the ninja got out of the canyonThe canyon gets flooded and each second the water level raises one meter Initially the water level is at the lower border of the first area Ninja cannot be on the area covered by water We can assume that the ninja and the water move in turns  first the ninja performs some action then the water raises for one meter then the ninja performs one more action and so onThe level is considered completed if the ninja manages to get out of the canyonAfter several failed attempts Vasya started to doubt whether it is possible to complete the level at all Help him answer the question
