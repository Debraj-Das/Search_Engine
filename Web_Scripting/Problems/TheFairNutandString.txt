The Fair Nut found a string s. The string consists of lowercase Latin letters. The Nut is a curious guy, so he wants to find the number of strictly increasing sequences p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k, such that:   For each i (1 \leq i \leq k), s_{p_i} = 'a'.  For each i (1 \leq i < k), there is such j that p_i < j < p_{i + 1} and s_j = 'b'. The Nut is upset because he doesn't know how to find the number. Help him.This number should be calculated modulo 10^9 + 7.
