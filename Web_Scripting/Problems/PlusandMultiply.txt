There is an infinite set generated as follows:  1 is in this set.  If x is in this set, x \cdot a and x+b both are in this set. For example, when a=3 and b=6, the five smallest elements of the set are:  1,  3 (1 is in this set, so 1\cdot a=3 is in this set),  7 (1 is in this set, so 1+b=7 is in this set),  9 (3 is in this set, so 3\cdot a=9 is in this set),  13 (7 is in this set, so 7+b=13 is in this set). Given positive integers a, b, n, determine if n is in this set.
