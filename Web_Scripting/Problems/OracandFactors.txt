Orac is studying number theory, and he is interested in the properties of divisors.For two positive integers a and b, a is a divisor of b if and only if there exists an integer c, such that a\cdot c=b.For n \ge 2, we will denote as f(n) the smallest positive divisor of n, except 1.For example, f(7)=7,f(10)=2,f(35)=5.For the fixed integer n, Orac decided to add f(n) to n. For example, if he had an integer n=5, the new value of n will be equal to 10. And if he had an integer n=6, n will be changed to 8.Orac loved it so much, so he decided to repeat this operation several times.Now, for two positive integers n and k, Orac asked you to add f(n) to n exactly k times (note that n will change after each operation, so f(n) may change too) and tell him the final value of n.For example, if Orac gives you n=5 and k=2, at first you should add f(5)=5 to n=5, so your new value of n will be equal to n=10, after that, you should add f(10)=2 to 10, so your new (and the final!) value of n will be equal to 12.Orac may ask you these queries many times.
