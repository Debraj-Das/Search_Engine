Tomorrow is a difficult day for Polycarp: he has to attend a lectures and b practical classes at the university! Since Polycarp is a diligent student, he is going to attend all of them.While preparing for the university, Polycarp wonders whether he can take enough writing implements to write all of the lectures and draw everything he has to during all of the practical classes. Polycarp writes lectures using a pen (he can't use a pencil to write lectures!); he can write down c lectures using one pen, and after that it runs out of ink. During practical classes Polycarp draws blueprints with a pencil (he can't use a pen to draw blueprints!); one pencil is enough to draw all blueprints during d practical classes, after which it is unusable.Polycarp's pencilcase can hold no more than k writing implements, so if Polycarp wants to take x pens and y pencils, they will fit in the pencilcase if and only if x + y \le k.Now Polycarp wants to know how many pens and pencils should he take. Help him to determine it, or tell that his pencilcase doesn't have enough room for all the implements he needs tomorrow!Note that you don't have to minimize the number of writing implements (though their total number must not exceed k).
