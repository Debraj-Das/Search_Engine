One day Kefa the parrot was walking down the street as he was on the way home from the restaurant when he saw something glittering by the road As he came nearer he understood that it was a watch He decided to take it to the pawnbroker to earn some money The pawnbroker said that each watch contains a serial number represented by a string of digits from 0 to 9 and the more quality checks this number passes the higher is the value of the watch The check is defined by three positive integers l r and d The watches pass a check if a substring of the serial number from l to r has period d Sometimes the pawnbroker gets distracted and Kefa changes in some substring of the serial number all digits to c in order to increase profit from the watch The seller has a lot of things to do to begin with and with Kefa messing about he gave you a task to write a program that determines the value of the watchLet us remind you that number x is called a period of string s 1xs if sisix for all i from 1 to sx
