Berland scientists noticed long ago that the world around them depends on Berland population Due to persistent research in this area the scientists managed to find out that the Berland chronology starts from the moment when the first two people came to that land it is considered to have happened in the first year After one Berland year after the start of the chronology the population had already equaled 13 people the second year However tracing the population number during the following years was an ultimately difficult task still it was found out that if di  the number of people in Berland in the year of i then either di12di2 or di13di112di2 Of course no one knows how many people are living in Berland at the moment but now we can tell if there could possibly be a year in which the country population equaled A Thats what we ask you to determine Also if possible you have to find out in which years it could be from the beginning of Berland chronology Lets suppose that it could be in the years of a1a2ak Then you have to define how many residents could be in the country during those years apart from the A variant Look at the examples for further explanation
