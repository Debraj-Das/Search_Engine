Sasha likes programming. Once, during a very long contest, Sasha decided that he was a bit tired and needed to relax. So he did. But since Sasha isn't an ordinary guy, he prefers to relax unusually. During leisure time Sasha likes to upsolve unsolved problems because upsolving is very useful.Therefore, Sasha decided to upsolve the following problem:You have an array a with n integers. You need to count the number of funny pairs (l, r) (l \leq r). To check if a pair (l, r) is a funny pair, take mid = \frac{l + r - 1}{2}, then if r - l + 1 is an even number and a_l \oplus a_{l+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{mid} = a_{mid + 1} \oplus a_{mid + 2} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_r, then the pair is funny. In other words, \oplus of elements of the left half of the subarray from l to r should be equal to \oplus of elements of the right half. Note that \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.It is time to continue solving the contest, so Sasha asked you to solve this task.
