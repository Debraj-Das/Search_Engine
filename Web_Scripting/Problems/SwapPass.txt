Based on a peculiar incident at basketball practice, Akari came up with the following competitive programming problem!You are given n points on the plane, no three of which are collinear. The i-th point initially has a label a_i, in such a way that the labels a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n form a permutation of 1, 2, \dots, n.You are allowed to modify the labels through the following operation:  Choose two distinct integers i and j between 1 and n.  Swap the labels of points i and j, and finally  Draw the segment between points i and j. A sequence of operations is valid if after applying all of the operations in the sequence in order, the k-th point ends up having the label k for all k between 1 and n inclusive, and the drawn segments don't intersect each other internally. Formally, if two of the segments intersect, then they must do so at a common endpoint of both segments.In particular, all drawn segments must be distinct.Find any valid sequence of operations, or say that none exist.
