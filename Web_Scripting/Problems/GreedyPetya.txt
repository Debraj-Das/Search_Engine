Petya is an unexperienced programming contestant. Recently he has come across the following problem:You are given a non-directed graph which consists of n nodes and m edges. Your task is to determine whether the graph contains a Hamiltonian path.Petya wrote a quick bug-free code which he believes solves this problem. After that Petya decided to give this problem for April Fools Day contest. Unfortunately, Petya might have made a mistake, and it's quite possible that his algorithm is wrong. But this isn't a good excuse to leave the contest without submitting this problem, is it?
