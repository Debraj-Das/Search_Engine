You want to arrange n integers a1a2an in some order in a row Lets define the value of an arrangement as the sum of differences between all pairs of adjacent integersMore formally lets denote some arrangement as a sequence of integers x1x2xn where sequence x is a permutation of sequence a The value of such an arrangement is x1x2x2x3xn1xnFind the largest possible value of an arrangement Then output the lexicographically smallest sequence x that corresponds to an arrangement of the largest possible value
