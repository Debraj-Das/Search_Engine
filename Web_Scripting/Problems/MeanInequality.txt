You are given an array a of 2n distinct integers. You want to arrange the elements of the array in a circle such that no element is equal to the the arithmetic mean of its 2 neighbours.More formally, find an array b, such that: b is a permutation of a.For every i from 1 to 2n, b_i \neq \frac{b_{i-1}+b_{i+1}}{2}, where b_0 = b_{2n} and b_{2n+1} = b_1. It can be proved that under the constraints of this problem, such array b always exists.
