AquaMoon has three integer arrays a, b, c of length n, where 1 \leq a_i, b_i, c_i \leq n for all i.In order to accelerate her potato farming, she organizes her farm in a manner based on these three arrays. She is now going to complete m operations to count how many potatoes she can get. Each operation will have one of the two types:  AquaMoon reorganizes their farm and makes the k-th element of the array a equal to x. In other words, perform the assignment a_k := x.  Given a positive integer r, AquaMoon receives a potato for each triplet (i,j,k), such that 1\le i<j<k\le r, and b_{a_i}=a_j=c_{a_k}. Count the number of such triplets. As AquaMoon is busy finding the library, help her complete all of their operations.
