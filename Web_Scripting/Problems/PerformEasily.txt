After battling Shikamaru, Tayuya decided that her flute is too predictable, and replaced it with a guitar. The guitar has 6 strings and an infinite number of frets numbered from 1. Fretting the fret number j on the i-th string produces the note a_{i} + j.Tayuya wants to play a melody of n notes. Each note can be played on different string-fret combination. The easiness of performance depends on the difference between the maximal and the minimal indices of used frets. The less this difference is, the easier it is to perform the technique. Please determine the minimal possible difference.For example, if a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], and the sequence of notes is 4, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13 (corresponding to the second example), we can play the first note on the first string, and all the other notes on the sixth string. Then the maximal fret will be 10, the minimal one will be 3, and the answer is 10 - 3 = 7, as shown on the picture.
