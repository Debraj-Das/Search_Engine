To become the king of Codeforces, Kuroni has to solve the following problem.He is given n numbers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. Help Kuroni to calculate \prod_{1\le i<j\le n} |a_i - a_j|. As result can be very big, output it modulo m.If you are not familiar with short notation, \prod_{1\le i<j\le n} |a_i - a_j| is equal to |a_1 - a_2|\cdot|a_1 - a_3|\cdot \dots \cdot|a_1 - a_n|\cdot|a_2 - a_3|\cdot|a_2 - a_4|\cdot \dots \cdot|a_2 - a_n| \cdot \dots \cdot |a_{n-1} - a_n|. In other words, this is the product of |a_i - a_j| for all 1\le i < j \le n.
