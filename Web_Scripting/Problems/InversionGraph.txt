You are given a permutation p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n. Then, an undirected graph is constructed in the following way: add an edge between vertices i, j such that i < j if and only if p_i > p_j. Your task is to count the number of connected components in this graph.Two vertices u and v belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting u and v.A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
