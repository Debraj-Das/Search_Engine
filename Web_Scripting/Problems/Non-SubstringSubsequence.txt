Hr0d1y has q queries on a binary string s of length n. A binary string is a string containing only characters '0' and '1'.A query is described by a pair of integers l_i, r_i (1 \leq l_i \lt r_i \leq n). For each query, he has to determine whether there exists a good subsequence in s that is equal to the substring s[l_i\ldots r_i].   A substring s[i\ldots j] of a string s is the string formed by characters s_i s_{i+1} \ldots s_j. String a is said to be a subsequence of string b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A subsequence is said to be good if it is not contiguous and has length \ge 2. For example, if s is "1100110", then the subsequences s_1s_2s_4 ("1100110") and s_1s_5s_7 ("1100110") are good, while s_1s_2s_3 ("1100110") is not good. Can you help Hr0d1y answer each query?
