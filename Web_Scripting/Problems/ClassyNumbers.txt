Let's call some positive integer classy if its decimal representation contains no more than 3 non-zero digits. For example, numbers 4, 200000, 10203 are classy and numbers 4231, 102306, 7277420000 are not.You are given a segment [L; R]. Count the number of classy integers x such that L \le x \le R.Each testcase contains several segments, for each of them you are required to solve the problem separately.
