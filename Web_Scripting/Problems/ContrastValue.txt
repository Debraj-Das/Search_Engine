For an array of integers [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n], let's call the value |a_1-a_2|+|a_2-a_3|+\cdots+|a_{n-1}-a_n| the contrast of the array. Note that the contrast of an array of size 1 is equal to 0.You are given an array of integers a. Your task is to build an array of b in such a way that all the following conditions are met:  b is not empty, i.e there is at least one element;  b is a subsequence of a, i.e b can be produced by deleting some elements from a (maybe zero);  the contrast of b is equal to the contrast of a. What is the minimum possible size of the array b?
