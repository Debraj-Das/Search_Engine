 \def\myred#1{\color{red}{\underline{\bf{#1}}}} \def\myblue#1{\color{blue}{\overline{\bf{#1}}}}  \def\RED{\myred{Red}} \def\BLUE{\myblue{Blue}}You are given a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Initially, all the elements of the sequence are unpainted. You can paint each number \RED or \BLUE (but not both), or leave it unpainted. For a color c, \text{Count}(c) is the number of elements in the sequence painted with that color and \text{Sum}(c) is the sum of the elements in the sequence painted with that color.For example, if the given sequence is [2, 8, 6, 3, 1] and it is painted this way: [\myblue{2}, 8, \myred{6}, \myblue{3}, 1] (where 6 is painted red, 2 and 3 are painted blue, 1 and 8 are unpainted) then \text{Sum}(\RED)=6, \text{Sum}(\BLUE)=2+3=5, \text{Count}(\RED)=1, and \text{Count}(\BLUE)=2.Determine if it is possible to paint the sequence so that \text{Sum}(\RED) > \text{Sum}(\BLUE) and \text{Count}(\RED) < \text{Count}(\BLUE).
