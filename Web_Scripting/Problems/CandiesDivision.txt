Santa has n candies and he wants to gift them to k kids. He wants to divide as many candies as possible between all k kids. Santa can't divide one candy into parts but he is allowed to not use some candies at all.Suppose the kid who recieves the minimum number of candies has a candies and the kid who recieves the maximum number of candies has b candies. Then Santa will be satisfied, if the both conditions are met at the same time:  b - a \le 1 (it means b = a or b = a + 1);  the number of kids who has a+1 candies (note that a+1 not necessarily equals b) does not exceed \lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor (less than or equal to \lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor). \lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor is k divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if k=5 then \lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor=\lfloor\frac{5}{2}\rfloor=2.Your task is to find the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will be satisfied.You have to answer t independent test cases.
