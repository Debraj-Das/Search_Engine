In Bubbleland a group of special programming forces gets a top secret job to calculate the number of potentially infected people by a new unknown virus. The state has a population of n people and every day there is new information about new contacts between people. The job of special programming forces is to calculate how many contacts in the last k days a given person had. The new virus has an incubation period of k days, and after that time people consider as non-infectious. Because the new virus is an extremely dangerous, government mark as suspicious everybody who had direct or indirect contact in the last k days, independently of the order of contacts.This virus is very strange, and people can't get durable immunity.You need to help special programming forces to calculate the number of suspicious people for a given person (number of people who had contact with a given person).There are 3 given inputs on beginning n where n is population, q number of queries, k virus incubation time in days. Each query is one of three types:    (x, y) person x and person y met that day (x \neq y).   (z) return the number of people in contact with z, counting himself.   The end of the current day moves on to the next day.
