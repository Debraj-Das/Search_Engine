Alice is a beginner composer and now she is ready to create another masterpiece. And not even the single one but two at the same time! Alice has a sheet with n notes written on it. She wants to take two such non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody and sum of their lengths is maximal.Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.Subsequence forms a melody when each two adjacent notes either differs by 1 or are congruent modulo 7.You should write a program which will calculate maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody.
