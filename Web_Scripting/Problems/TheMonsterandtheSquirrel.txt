Ari the monster always wakes up very early with the first ray of the sun and the first thing she does is feeding her squirrelAri draws a regular convex polygon on the floor and numbers its vertices 12n in clockwise order Then starting from the vertex 1 she draws a ray in the direction of each other vertex The ray stops when it reaches a vertex or intersects with another ray drawn before Ari repeats this process for vertex 23n in this particular order And then she puts a walnut in each region inside the polygon  Ada the squirrel wants to collect all the walnuts but she is not allowed to step on the lines drawn by Ari That means Ada have to perform a small jump if she wants to go from one region to another Ada can jump from one region P to another region Q if and only if P and Q share a side or a cornerAssuming that Ada starts from outside of the picture what is the minimum number of jumps she has to perform in order to collect all the walnuts
