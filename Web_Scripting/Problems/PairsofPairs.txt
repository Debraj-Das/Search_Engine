You have a simple and connected undirected graph consisting of n nodes and m edges.Consider any way to pair some subset of these n nodes such that no node is present in more than one pair. This pairing is valid if for every pair of pairs, the induced subgraph containing all 4 nodes, two from each pair, has at most 2 edges (out of the 6 possible edges). More formally, for any two pairs, (a,b) and (c,d), the induced subgraph with nodes \{a,b,c,d\} should have at most 2 edges. Please note that the subgraph induced by a set of nodes contains nodes only from this set and edges which have both of its end points in this set.Now, do one of the following:   Find a simple path consisting of at least \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil nodes. Here, a path is called simple if it does not visit any node multiple times.  Find a valid pairing in which at least \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil nodes are paired. It can be shown that it is possible to find at least one of the two in every graph satisfying constraints from the statement.
