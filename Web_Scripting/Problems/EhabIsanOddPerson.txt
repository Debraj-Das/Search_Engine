You're given an array a of length n. You can perform the following operation on it as many times as you want:  Pick two integers i and j (1 \le i,j \le n) such that a_i+a_j is odd, then swap a_i and a_j. What is lexicographically the smallest array you can obtain?An array x is lexicographically smaller than an array y if there exists an index i such that x_i<y_i, and x_j=y_j for all 1 \le j < i. Less formally, at the first index i in which they differ, x_i<y_i
