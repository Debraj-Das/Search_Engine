Mr. Chanek just won the national chess tournament and got a huge chessboard of size N \times M. Bored with playing conventional chess, Mr. Chanek now defines a function F(X, Y), which denotes the minimum number of moves to move a knight from square (1, 1) to square (X, Y). It turns out finding F(X, Y) is too simple, so Mr. Chanek defines:G(X, Y) = \sum_{i=X}^{N} \sum_{j=Y}^{M} F(i, j)Given X and Y, you are tasked to find G(X, Y).A knight can move from square (a, b) to square (a', b') if and only if |a - a'| > 0, |b - b'| > 0, and |a - a'| + |b - b'| = 3. Of course, the knight cannot leave the chessboard.
