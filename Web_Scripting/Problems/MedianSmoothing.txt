A schoolboy named Vasya loves reading books on programming and mathematics He has recently read an encyclopedia article that described the method of median smoothing or median filter and its many applications in science and engineering Vasya liked the idea of the method very much and he decided to try it in practiceApplying the simplest variant of median smoothing to the sequence of numbers a1a2an will result a new sequence b1b2bn obtained by the following algorithm  b1a1 bnan that is the first and the last number of the new sequence match the corresponding numbers of the original sequence  For i2n1 value bi is equal to the median of three values ai1 ai and ai1 The median of a set of three numbers is the number that goes on the second place when these three numbers are written in the nondecreasing order For example the median of the set 5 1 2 is number 2 and the median of set 1 0 1 is equal to 1In order to make the task easier Vasya decided to apply the method to sequences consisting of zeros and ones onlyHaving made the procedure once Vasya looked at the resulting sequence and thought what if I apply the algorithm to it once again and then apply it to the next result and so on Vasya tried a couple of examples and found out that after some number of median smoothing algorithm applications the sequence can stop changing We say that the sequence is stable if it does not change when the median smoothing is applied to itNow Vasya wonders whether the sequence always eventually becomes stable He asks you to write a program that given a sequence of zeros and ones will determine whether it ever becomes stable Moreover if it ever becomes stable then you should determine what will it look like and how many times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to initial sequence in order to obtain a stable one
