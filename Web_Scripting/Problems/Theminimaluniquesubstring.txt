Let s be some string consisting of symbols "0" or "1". Let's call a string t a substring of string s, if there exists such number 1 \leq l \leq |s| - |t| + 1 that t = s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_{l + |t| - 1}. Let's call a substring t of string s unique, if there exist only one such l. For example, let s = "1010111". A string t = "010" is an unique substring of s, because l = 2 is the only one suitable number. But, for example t = "10" isn't a unique substring of s, because l = 1 and l = 3 are suitable. And for example t ="00" at all isn't a substring of s, because there is no suitable l.Today Vasya solved the following problem at the informatics lesson: given a string consisting of symbols "0" and "1", the task is to find the length of its minimal unique substring. He has written a solution to this problem and wants to test it. He is asking you to help him.You are given 2 positive integers n and k, such that (n \bmod 2) = (k \bmod 2), where (x \bmod 2) is operation of taking remainder of x by dividing on 2. Find any string s consisting of n symbols "0" or "1", such that the length of its minimal unique substring is equal to k.
