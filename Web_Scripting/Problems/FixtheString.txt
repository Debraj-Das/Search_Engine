A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters 1 and  between the original characters of the sequence For example  bracket sequences  and  are regular the resulting expressions are 11 and 111  bracket sequences   and  are not You are given two strings s and a the string s has length n the string a has length n  3 The string s is a bracket sequence ie each element of this string is either an opening bracket character or a closing bracket character The string a is a binary string ie each element of this string is either 1 or 0The string a imposes some constraints on the string s for every i such that ai is 1 the string si si1 si2 si3 should be a regular bracket sequence Characters of a equal to 0 dont impose any constraintsInitially the string s may or may not meet these constraints You can perform the following operation any number of times replace some character of s with its inverse ie you can replace an opening bracket with a closing bracket or vice versaDetermine if it is possible to change some characters in s so that it meets all of the constraints and if it is possible calculate the minimum number of characters to be changed
