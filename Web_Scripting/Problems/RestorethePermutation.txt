A sequence of n numbers is called permutation if it contains all numbers from 1 to n exactly once. For example, the sequences [3, 1, 4, 2], [1] and [2,1] are permutations, but [1,2,1], [0,1] and [1,3,4] — are not.For a permutation p of even length n you can make an array b of length \frac{n}{2} such that:   b_i = \max(p_{2i - 1}, p_{2i}) for 1 \le i \le \frac{n}{2} For example, if p = [2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 6], then:   b_1 = \max(p_1, p_2) = \max(2, 4) = 4  b_2 = \max(p_3, p_4) = \max(3,1)=3  b_3 = \max(p_5, p_6) = \max(5,6) = 6  As a result, we made b = [4, 3, 6].For a given array b, find the lexicographically minimal permutation p such that you can make the given array b from it.If b = [4,3,6], then the lexicographically minimal permutation from which it can be made is p = [1,4,2,3,5,6], since:   b_1 = \max(p_1, p_2) = \max(1, 4) = 4  b_2 = \max(p_3, p_4) = \max(2, 3) = 3  b_3 = \max(p_5, p_6) = \max(5, 6) = 6 A permutation x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n is lexicographically smaller than a permutation y_1, y_2 \dots, y_n if and only if there exists such i (1 \le i \le n) that x_1=y_1, x_2=y_2, \dots, x_{i-1}=y_{i-1} and x_i<y_i.
