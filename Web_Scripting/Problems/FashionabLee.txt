Lee is going to fashionably decorate his house for a party, using some regular convex polygons...Lee thinks a regular n-sided (convex) polygon is beautiful if and only if he can rotate it in such a way that at least one of its edges is parallel to the OX-axis and at least one of its edges is parallel to the OY-axis at the same time.Recall that a regular n-sided polygon is a convex polygon with n vertices such that all the edges and angles are equal.Now he is shopping: the market has t regular polygons. For each of them print YES if it is beautiful and NO otherwise.
