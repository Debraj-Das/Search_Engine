As technologies develop, manufacturers are making the process of unlocking a phone as user-friendly as possible. To unlock its new phone, Arkady's pet dog Mu-mu has to bark the password once. The phone represents a password as a string of two lowercase English letters.Mu-mu's enemy Kashtanka wants to unlock Mu-mu's phone to steal some sensible information, but it can only bark n distinct words, each of which can be represented as a string of two lowercase English letters. Kashtanka wants to bark several words (not necessarily distinct) one after another to pronounce a string containing the password as a substring. Tell if it's possible to unlock the phone in this way, or not.
