A positive integer is called composite if it can be represented as a product of two positive integers, both greater than 1. For example, the following numbers are composite: 6, 4, 120, 27. The following numbers aren't: 1, 2, 3, 17, 97.Alice is given a sequence of n composite numbers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n.She wants to choose an integer m \le 11 and color each element one of m colors from 1 to m so that:  for each color from 1 to m there is at least one element of this color;  each element is colored and colored exactly one color;  the greatest common divisor of any two elements that are colored the same color is greater than 1, i.e. \gcd(a_i, a_j)>1 for each pair i, j if these elements are colored the same color. Note that equal elements can be colored different colors — you just have to choose one of m colors for each of the indices from 1 to n.Alice showed already that if all a_i \le 1000 then she can always solve the task by choosing some m \le 11.Help Alice to find the required coloring. Note that you don't have to minimize or maximize the number of colors, you just have to find the solution with some m from 1 to 11.
