You have a rectangular board of size n\times m (n rows, m columns). The n rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and the m columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell at the intersection of row i and column j contains the number i^j (i raised to the power of j). For example, if n=3 and m=3 the board is as follows:  Find the number of distinct integers written on the board.
