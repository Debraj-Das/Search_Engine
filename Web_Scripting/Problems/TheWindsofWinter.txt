Given a rooted tree with n nodes. The Night King removes exactly one node from the tree and all the edges associated with it. Doing this splits the tree and forms a forest. The node which is removed is not a part of the forest.The root of a tree in the forest is the node in that tree which does not have a parent. We define the strength of the forest as the size of largest tree in forest.Jon Snow wants to minimize the strength of the forest. To do this he can perform the following operation at most once.He removes the edge between a node and its parent and inserts a new edge between this node and any other node in forest such that the total number of trees in forest remain same.For each node v you need to find the minimum value of strength of the forest formed when node v is removed.
