You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters a and/or b.Let \operatorname{AB}(s) be the number of occurrences of string ab in s as a substring. Analogically, \operatorname{BA}(s) is the number of occurrences of ba in s as a substring.In one step, you can choose any index i and replace s_i with character a or b.What is the minimum number of steps you need to make to achieve \operatorname{AB}(s) = \operatorname{BA}(s)?Reminder:The number of occurrences of string d in s as substring is the number of indices i (1 \le i \le |s| - |d| + 1) such that substring s_i s_{i + 1} \dots s_{i + |d| - 1} is equal to d. For example, \operatorname{AB}(aabbbabaa) = 2 since there are two indices i: i = 2 where aabbbabaa and i = 6 where aabbbabaa.
