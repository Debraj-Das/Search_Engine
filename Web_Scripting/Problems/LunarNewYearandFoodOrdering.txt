Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is planning to go for a famous restaurant — "Alice's".The restaurant "Alice's" serves n kinds of food. The cost for the i-th kind is always c_i. Initially, the restaurant has enough ingredients for serving exactly a_i dishes of the i-th kind. In the New Year's Eve, m customers will visit Alice's one after another and the j-th customer will order d_j dishes of the t_j-th kind of food. The (i + 1)-st customer will only come after the i-th customer is completely served.Suppose there are r_i dishes of the i-th kind remaining (initially r_i = a_i). When a customer orders 1 dish of the i-th kind, the following principles will be processed. If r_i > 0, the customer will be served exactly 1 dish of the i-th kind. The cost for the dish is c_i. Meanwhile, r_i will be reduced by 1. Otherwise, the customer will be served 1 dish of the cheapest available kind of food if there are any. If there are multiple cheapest kinds of food, the one with the smallest index among the cheapest will be served. The cost will be the cost for the dish served and the remain for the corresponding dish will be reduced by 1. If there are no more dishes at all, the customer will leave angrily. Therefore, no matter how many dishes are served previously, the cost for the customer is 0.If the customer doesn't leave after the d_j dishes are served, the cost for the customer will be the sum of the cost for these d_j dishes.Please determine the total cost for each of the m customers.
