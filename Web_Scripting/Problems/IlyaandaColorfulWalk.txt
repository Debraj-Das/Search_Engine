Ilya lives in a beautiful city of Chordalsk.There are n houses on the street Ilya lives, they are numerated from 1 to n from left to right; the distance between every two neighboring houses is equal to 1 unit. The neighboring houses are 1 and 2, 2 and 3, ..., n-1 and n. The houses n and 1 are not neighboring.The houses are colored in colors c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n so that the i-th house is colored in the color c_i. Everyone knows that Chordalsk is not boring, so there are at least two houses colored in different colors.Ilya wants to select two houses i and j so that 1 \leq i < j \leq n, and they have different colors: c_i \neq c_j. He will then walk from the house i to the house j the distance of (j-i) units.Ilya loves long walks, so he wants to choose the houses so that the distance between them is the maximum possible.Help Ilya, find this maximum possible distance.
