Salem gave you n sticks with integer positive lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from a to b is |a - b|, where |x| means the absolute value of x.A stick length a_i is called almost good for some integer t if |a_i - t| \le 1.Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer t and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of t is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. As an answer, print the value of t and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for t, print any of them.
