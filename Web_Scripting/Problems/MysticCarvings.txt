The polar bears have discovered a gigantic circular piece of floating ice with some mystic carvings on it There are n lines carved on the ice Each line connects two points on the boundary of the ice we call these points endpoints The endpoints are numbered 122n counterclockwise along the circumference No two lines share an endpointNow a group of 6 polar bears Alice Bob Carol Dave Eve Frank are going to build caves on the endpoints Each polar bear would build a cave and live in it No two polar bears can build a cave on the same endpoints Alice and Bob is a pair of superstitious lovers They believe the lines are carved by aliens or humans which are pretty much the same thing to polar bears and have certain spiritual power Therefore they want to build their caves on two endpoints which are connected by a line The same for Carol and Dave Eve and FrankThe distance between two caves X and Y is defined as one plus minimum number of other caves one need to pass through in order to travel from X to Y along the boundary of the ice endpoints without caves are not countedTo ensure fairness the distances between the three pairs of lovers have to be the same that is the distance between Alice and Bob the distance between Carol and Dave and the distance between Eve and Frank are the sameThe figures below show two different configurations where the dots on the circle are the endpoints The configuration on the left is not valid Although each pair of lovers A and B C and D E and F is connected a line the distance requirement is not satisfied The distance between A and B is 2 one can go from A to B in the clockwise direction passing through F The distance between E and F is also 2 However the distance between C and D is 1 one can go from C to D in the counterclockwise direction without passing through any other caves The configuration on the right is valid All three pairs have the same distance 1  Count the number of ways to build the caves under the requirements Two configurations are considered the same if the same set of 6 endpoints are used
