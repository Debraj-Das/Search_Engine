You are playing a variation of game 2048. Initially you have a multiset s of n integers. Every integer in this multiset is a power of two. You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations with this multiset.During each operation you choose two equal integers from s, remove them from s and insert the number equal to their sum into s.For example, if s = \{1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2\} and you choose integers 2 and 2, then the multiset becomes \{1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2\}.You win if the number 2048 belongs to your multiset. For example, if s = \{1024, 512, 512, 4\} you can win as follows: choose 512 and 512, your multiset turns into \{1024, 1024, 4\}. Then choose 1024 and 1024, your multiset turns into \{2048, 4\} and you win.You have to determine if you can win this game.You have to answer q independent queries.
