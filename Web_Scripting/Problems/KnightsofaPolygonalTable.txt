Unlike Knights of a Round Table, Knights of a Polygonal Table deprived of nobility and happy to kill each other. But each knight has some power and a knight can kill another knight if and only if his power is greater than the power of victim. However, even such a knight will torment his conscience, so he can kill no more than k other knights. Also, each knight has some number of coins. After a kill, a knight can pick up all victim's coins.Now each knight ponders: how many coins he can have if only he kills other knights?You should answer this question for each knight.
