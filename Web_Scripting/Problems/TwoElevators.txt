Vlad went into his appartment house entrance, now he is on the 1-th floor. He was going to call the elevator to go up to his apartment.There are only two elevators in his house. Vlad knows for sure that:  the first elevator is currently on the floor a (it is currently motionless),  the second elevator is located on floor b and goes to floor c (b \ne c). Please note, if b=1, then the elevator is already leaving the floor 1 and Vlad does not have time to enter it. If you call the first elevator, it will immediately start to go to the floor 1. If you call the second one, then first it will reach the floor c and only then it will go to the floor 1. It takes |x - y| seconds for each elevator to move from floor x to floor y.Vlad wants to call an elevator that will come to him faster. Help him choose such an elevator.
