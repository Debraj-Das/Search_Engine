Serval loves Brain Power and his brain power problem.Serval defines that a string T is powerful iff T can be obtained by concatenating some string T' multiple times. Formally speaking, T is powerful iff there exist a string T' and an integer k\geq 2 such that T=\underbrace{T'+T'+\dots+T'}_{k\text{ times}}For example, gogogo is powerful because it can be obtained by concatenating go three times, but power is not powerful.Serval has a string S consists of lowercase English letters. He is curious about the longest powerful subsequence of S, and he only needs you to find out the length of it. If all the non-empty subsequences of S is not powerful, the answer is considered to be 0.A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.
