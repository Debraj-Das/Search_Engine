Polycarp has 3 positive integers a, b and c. He can perform the following operation exactly once.  Choose a positive integer m and multiply exactly one of the integers a, b or c by m. Can Polycarp make it so that after performing the operation, the sequence of three numbers a, b, c (in this order) forms an arithmetic progression? Note that you cannot change the order of a, b and c.Formally, a sequence x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n is called an arithmetic progression (AP) if there exists a number d (called "common difference") such that x_{i+1}=x_i+d for all i from 1 to n-1. In this problem, n=3.For example, the following sequences are AP: [5, 10, 15], [3, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], and [13, 10, 7]. The following sequences are not AP: [1, 2, 4], [0, 1, 0] and [1, 3, 2].You need to answer t independent test cases.
