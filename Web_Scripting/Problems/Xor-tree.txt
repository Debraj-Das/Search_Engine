Iahub is very proud of his recent discovery, propagating trees. Right now, he invented a new tree, called xor-tree. After this new revolutionary discovery, he invented a game for kids which uses xor-trees.The game is played on a tree having n nodes, numbered from 1 to n. Each node i has an initial value initi, which is either 0 or 1. The root of the tree is node 1.One can perform several (possibly, zero) operations on the tree during the game. The only available type of operation is to pick a node x. Right after someone has picked node x, the value of node x flips, the values of sons of x remain the same, the values of sons of sons of x flips, the values of sons of sons of sons of x remain the same and so on.The goal of the game is to get each node i to have value goali, which can also be only 0 or 1. You need to reach the goal of the game by using minimum number of operations.
