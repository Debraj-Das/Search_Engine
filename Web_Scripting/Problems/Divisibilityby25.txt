You are given an integer n from 1 to 10^{18} without leading zeroes.In one move you can swap any two adjacent digits in the given number in such a way that the resulting number will not contain leading zeroes. In other words, after each move the number you have cannot contain any leading zeroes.What is the minimum number of moves you have to make to obtain a number that is divisible by 25? Print -1 if it is impossible to obtain a number that is divisible by 25.
