You are given an array a consisting of n non-negative integers.The numbness of a subarray a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r (for arbitrary l \leq r) is defined as \max(a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r) \oplus (a_l \oplus a_{l+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_r), where \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.Find the maximum numbness over all subarrays.
