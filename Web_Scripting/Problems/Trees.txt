On Bertowns main street n trees are growing the tree number i has the height of ai meters 1in By the arrival of the President of Berland these trees were decided to be changed so that their heights formed a beautiful sequence This means that the heights of trees on ends the 1st one and the nth one should be equal to each other the heights of the 2nd and the n1th tree must also be equal to each other at that the height of the 2nd tree should be larger than the height of the first tree by 1 and so on In other words the heights of the trees standing at equal distance from the edge of one end of the sequence must be equal to each other and with the increasing of the distance from the edge by 1 the tree height must also increase by 1 For example the sequences 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 and 1 2 3 2 1 are beautiful and 1 3 3 1 and 1 2 3 1 are not Changing the height of a tree is a very expensive operation using advanced technologies invented by Berland scientists In one operation you can choose any tree and change its height to any number either increase or decrease Note that even after the change the height should remain a positive integer i e it cant be less than or equal to zero Identify the smallest number of changes of the trees height needed for the sequence of their heights to become beautiful
