 Mom bought the boy Vasya a n-dimensional chocolate bar, which is a n-dimensional cube with the length of each side equal to 1. The chocolate is planned to be divided into slices. According to the ith dimension, it can be divided by hyperplanes into a_i equal parts. Thus, the chocolate is divided in total into a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot a_3 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_n slices, each slice has a length of i-th dimension equal to \frac{1}{a_i}, respectively, the volume of each slice is \frac{1}{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}.Vasya and his friends want to cut a chocolate bar to get at least k pieces, while Vasya wants to maximize the volume of the smallest of them. It is possible to cut the chocolate bar only at the junction of the lobules, and each incision must pass through the entire chocolate bar along some hyperplane involved in the formation of lobules. Only after making all the cuts, Vasya disassembles the chocolate into pieces.More formally, Vasya wants to choose the numbers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le a_i) — the number of parts into which Vasya will cut the chocolate bar along each dimension. The condition b_1 \cdot b_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot b_n \ge k must be met to get at least k pieces after all cuts. It can be noted that with optimal cutting with such parameters, the minimum piece will contain \lfloor \frac{a_1}{b_1} \rfloor \dotsm \lfloor \frac{a_n}{b_n} \rfloor slices, and its volume will be equal to \lfloor \frac{a_1}{b_1} \rfloor \dotsm \lfloor \frac{a_n}{b_n} \rfloor \cdot \frac{1}{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}.Vasya wants to get the maximum possible value of the volume of the minimum piece multiplied by k, that is, he wants to maximize the number of \lfloor \frac{a_1}{b_1} \rfloor \dotsm \lfloor \frac{a_n}{b_n} \rfloor \cdot \frac{1}{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n} \cdot k. Help him with this.
