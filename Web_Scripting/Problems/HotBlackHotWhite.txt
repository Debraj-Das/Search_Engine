One day, you are accepted as being Dr. Chanek's assistant. The first task given by Dr. Chanek to you is to take care and store his magical stones.Dr. Chanek has N magical stones with N being an even number. Those magical stones are numbered from 1 to N. Magical stone i has a strength of A_i. A magical stone can be painted with two colours, namely the colour black or the colour white. You are tasked to paint the magical stones with the colour black or white and store the magical stones into a magic box with a magic coefficient Z (0 \leq Z \leq 2). The painting of the magical stones must be done in a way such that there are \frac{N}{2} black magical stones and \frac{N}{2} white magical stones.Define \text{concat}(x, y) for two integers x and y as the result of concatenating the digits of x to the left of y in their decimal representation without changing the order. As an example, \text{concat}(10, 24) will result in 1024.For a magic box with a magic coefficient Z, magical stone i will react with magical stone j if the colours of both stones are different and \text{concat}(A_i, A_j) \times \text{concat}(A_j, A_i) + A_i \times A_j \equiv Z \mod 3. A magical stone that is reacting will be very hot and dangerous. Because of that, you must colour the magical stones and determine the magic coefficient Z of the magic box in a way such that there is no magical stone that reacts, or report if it is impossible.
