Fox Ciel and her friends are in a dancing room. There are n boys and m girls here, and they never danced before. There will be some songs, during each song, there must be exactly one boy and one girl are dancing. Besides, there is a special rule:  either the boy in the dancing pair must dance for the first time (so, he didn't dance with anyone before);  or the girl in the dancing pair must dance for the first time. Help Fox Ciel to make a schedule that they can dance as many songs as possible.
