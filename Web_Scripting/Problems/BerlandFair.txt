XXI Berland Annual Fair is coming really soon! Traditionally fair consists of n booths, arranged in a circle. The booths are numbered 1 through n clockwise with n being adjacent to 1. The i-th booths sells some candies for the price of a_i burles per item. Each booth has an unlimited supply of candies.Polycarp has decided to spend at most T burles at the fair. However, he has some plan in mind for his path across the booths:  at first, he visits booth number 1;  if he has enough burles to buy exactly one candy from the current booth, then he buys it immediately;  then he proceeds to the next booth in the clockwise order (regardless of if he bought a candy or not). Polycarp's money is finite, thus the process will end once he can no longer buy candy at any booth.Calculate the number of candies Polycarp will buy.
