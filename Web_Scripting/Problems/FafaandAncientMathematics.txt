Ancient Egyptians are known to have understood difficult concepts in mathematics The ancient Egyptian mathematician Ahmes liked to write a kind of arithmetic expressions on papyrus paper which he called as Ahmes arithmetic expressionAn Ahmes arithmetic expression can be defined as   d is an Ahmes arithmetic expression where d is a onedigit positive integer  E1opE2 is an Ahmes arithmetic expression where E1 and E2 are valid Ahmes arithmetic expressions without spaces and op is either plus  or minus   For example 5 11 and 1235 are valid Ahmes arithmetic expressionsOn his trip to Egypt Fafa found a piece of papyrus paper having one of these Ahmes arithmetic expressions written on it Being very ancient the papyrus piece was very worn out As a result all the operators were erased keeping only the numbers and the brackets Since Fafa loves mathematics he decided to challenge himself with the following taskGiven the number of plus and minus operators in the original expression find out the maximum possible value for the expression on the papyrus paper after putting the plus and minus operators in the place of the original erased operators
