You are given a square matrix A of size n \times n whose elements are integers. We will denote the element on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column as A_{i,j}.You can perform operations on the matrix. In each operation, you can choose an integer k, then for each index i (1 \leq i \leq n), swap A_{i, k} with A_{k, i}. Note that cell A_{k, k} remains unchanged.For example, for n = 4 and k = 3, this matrix will be transformed like this:  The operation k = 3 swaps the blue row with the green column. You can perform this operation any number of times. Find the lexicographically smallest matrix^\dagger you can obtain after performing arbitrary number of operations.{}^\dagger For two matrices A and B of size n \times n, let a_{(i-1) \cdot n + j} = A_{i,j} and b_{(i-1) \cdot n + j} = B_{i,j}. Then, the matrix A is lexicographically smaller than the matrix B when there exists an index i (1 \leq i \leq n^2) such that a_i < b_i and for all indices j such that 1 \leq j < i, a_j = b_j.
