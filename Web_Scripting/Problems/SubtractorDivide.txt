Ridbit starts with an integer n.In one move, he can perform one of the following operations:   divide n by one of its proper divisors, or  subtract 1 from n if n is greater than 1. A proper divisor is a divisor of a number, excluding itself. For example, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10 are proper divisors of 20, but 20 itself is not.What is the minimum number of moves Ridbit is required to make to reduce n to 1?
