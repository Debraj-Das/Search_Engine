Additionally, you know that the total score of all students is t.Furthermore, you took a glance at the final ranklist of the quiz. The students were ranked from 1 to m, where rank 1 has the highest score and rank m has the lowest score. Ties were broken arbitrarily.You know that the student at rank p_i had a score of s_i for 1 \le i \le q.You wonder if there could have been a huge tie for first place.
