On Codeforces the "Recent Actions" field shows the last n posts with recent actions.Initially, there are posts 1, 2, \ldots, n in the field (this is in order from top to down). Also there are infinitely many posts not in the field, numbered with integers n + 1, n + 2, \ldots.When recent action happens in the post p:  If it is in the "Recent Actions" field, it moves from its position to the top position.  Otherwise, it is added to the top position, and the post on the down position is removed from the "Recent Actions" field. You know, that the next m recent actions will happen in the posts p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m (n + 1 \leq p_i \leq n + m) in the moments of time 1, 2, \ldots, m. Note, that recent actions only happen with posts with numbers \geq n + 1.For each post i (1 \leq i \leq n), find the first time it will be removed from the "Recent Actions" field or say, that it won't be removed.
