There are n people participating in some contest, they start participating in x minutes intervals. That means the first participant starts at time 0, the second participant starts at time x, the third — at time 2 \cdot x, and so on.Duration of contest is t minutes for each participant, so the first participant finishes the contest at time t, the second — at time t + x, and so on. When a participant finishes the contest, their dissatisfaction equals to the number of participants that started the contest (or starting it now), but haven't yet finished it.Determine the sum of dissatisfaction of all participants.
