Oh, no!The coronavirus has caught you, and now you're sitting in a dark cellar, with tied legs (but not hands). You have a delicious cookie, a laptop in front of you, and your ideal development environment is open. The coronavirus convinces you to solve the following problem.You are given two arrays A and B of size n. You can do operations of two types with array A:   Reverse array A. That is the array [A_1,\ A_2,\ \ldots,\ A_n] transformes into [A_n,\ A_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ A_1].  Replace A with an array of its prefix sums. That is, the array [A_1,\ A_2,\ \ldots,\ A_n] goes to [A_1,\ (A_1+A_2),\ \ldots,\ (A_1+A_2+\ldots+A_n)]. You need to understand if you can get an array B from the array A. If it is possible, you will have to restore the order of these operations by minimizing the number of operations of the second type. Fortunately, the coronavirus is good today, so he has allowed you not to restore actions if the minimum number of second type operations is more than 2\cdot 10^5. But coronavirus resents you, so if you restore the answer, the total number of operations should not exceed 5\cdot 10^5.Solve this problem and get the cookie, or the coronavirus will extend the quarantine for five years and make the whole economy collapse!
