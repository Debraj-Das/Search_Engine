The sequence of integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k is called a good array if a_1 = k - 1 and a_1 > 0. For example, the sequences [3, -1, 44, 0], [1, -99] are good arrays, and the sequences [3, 7, 8], [2, 5, 4, 1], [0] — are not.A sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1, 4], [1, 2, 3, -3, -9, 4] are good, and the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 3, -3 -9, 4, 1] — are not.For a given sequence of numbers, count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353.
