Luyi has n circles on the plane The ith circle is centered at xiyi At the time zero circles start to grow simultaneously In other words the radius of each circle at time t t0 is equal to t The circles are drawn as black discs on an infinite white plane So at each moment the plane consists of several black and white regions Note that the circles may overlap while growing  We define a hole as a closed connected white region For instance the figure contains two holes shown by red border During growing some holes may be created and it is easy to see that each created hole will disappear eventually Luyi asks you to find moment of time such that the last hole disappears In other words you should find the first moment such that no hole can be seen after that
