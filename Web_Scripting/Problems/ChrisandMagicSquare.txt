ZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon arrived at the entrance of Udayland There is a nn magic grid on the entrance which is filled with integers Chris noticed that exactly one of the cells in the grid is empty and to enter Udayland they need to fill a positive integer into the empty cellChris tried filling in random numbers but it didnt work ZS the Coder realizes that they need to fill in a positive integer such that the numbers in the grid form a magic square This means that he has to fill in a positive integer so that the sum of the numbers in each row of the grid  each column of the grid  and the two long diagonals of the grid the main diagonal  and the secondary diagonal  are equal Chris doesnt know what number to fill in Can you help Chris find the correct positive integer to fill in or determine that it is impossible
