Youve gotten an nm sheet of squared paper Some of its squares are painted Lets mark the set of all painted squares as A Set A is connected Your task is to find the minimum number of squares that we can delete from set A to make it not connectedA set of painted squares is called connected if for every two squares a and b from this set there is a sequence of squares from the set beginning in a and ending in b such that in this sequence any square except for the last one shares a common side with the square that follows next in the sequence An empty set and a set consisting of exactly one square are connected by definition
