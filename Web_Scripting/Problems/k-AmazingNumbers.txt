You are given an array a consisting of n integers numbered from 1 to n.Let's define the k-amazing number of the array as the minimum number that occurs in all of the subsegments of the array having length k (recall that a subsegment of a of length k is a contiguous part of a containing exactly k elements). If there is no integer occuring in all subsegments of length k for some value of k, then the k-amazing number is -1.For each k from 1 to n calculate the k-amazing number of the array a.
