Mike is trying rock climbing but he is awful at it There are n holds on the wall ith hold is at height ai off the ground Besides let the sequence ai increase that is aiai1 for all i from 1 to n1 we will call such sequence a track Mike thinks that the track a1  an has difficulty  In other words difficulty equals the maximum distance between two holds that are adjacent in heightToday Mike decided to cover the track with holds hanging on heights a1  an To make the problem harder Mike decided to remove one hold that is remove one element of the sequence for example if we take the sequence 12345 and remove the third element from it we obtain the sequence 1245 However as Mike is awful at climbing he wants the final difficulty ie the maximum difference of heights between adjacent holds after removing the hold to be as small as possible among all possible options of removing a hold The first and last holds must stay at their positionsHelp Mike determine the minimum difficulty of the track after removing one hold
