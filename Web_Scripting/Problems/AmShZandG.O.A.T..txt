Let's call an array of k integers c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k terrible, if the following condition holds:Let AVG be the \frac{c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_k}{k}(the average of all the elements of the array, it doesn't have to be integer). Then the number of elements of the array which are bigger than AVG should be strictly larger than the number of elements of the array which are smaller than AVG. Note that elements equal to AVG don't count.For example c = \{1, 4, 4, 5, 6\} is terrible because AVG = 4.0 and 5-th and 4-th elements are greater than AVG and 1-st element is smaller than AVG.Let's call an array of m integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m bad, if at least one of its non-empty subsequences is terrible, and good otherwise.You are given an array of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Find the minimum number of elements that you have to delete from it to obtain a good array.An array is a subsequence of another array if it can be obtained from it by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
