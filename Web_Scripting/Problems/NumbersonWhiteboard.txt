Numbers 1, 2, 3, \dots n (each integer from 1 to n once) are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers a and b from the board and write one integer \frac{a + b}{2} rounded up instead.You should perform the given operation n - 1 times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible. For example, if n = 4, the following course of action is optimal:  choose a = 4 and b = 2, so the new number is 3, and the whiteboard contains [1, 3, 3];  choose a = 3 and b = 3, so the new number is 3, and the whiteboard contains [1, 3];  choose a = 1 and b = 3, so the new number is 2, and the whiteboard contains [2]. It's easy to see that after n - 1 operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.
