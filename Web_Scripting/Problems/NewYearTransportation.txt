New Year is coming in Line World In this world there are n cells numbered by integers from 1 to n as a 1n board People live in cells However it was hard to move between distinct cells because of the difficulty of escaping the cell People wanted to meet people who live in other cellsSo user tncks0121 has made a transportation system to move between these cells to celebrate the New Year First he thought of n1 positive integers a1a2an1 For every integer i where 1in1 the condition 1aini holds Next he made n1 portals numbered by integers from 1 to n1 The ith 1in1 portal connects cell i and cell iai and one can travel from cell i to cell iai using the ith portal Unfortunately one cannot use the portal backwards which means one cannot move from cell iai to cell i using the ith portal It is easy to see that because of condition 1aini one cant leave the Line World using portalsCurrently I am standing at cell 1 and I want to go to cell t However I dont know whether it is possible to go there Please determine whether I can go to cell t by only using the construted transportation system
