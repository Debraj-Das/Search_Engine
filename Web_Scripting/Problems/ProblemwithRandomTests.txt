You are given a string s consisting of n characters. Each character of s is either 0 or 1.A substring of s is a contiguous subsequence of its characters.You have to choose two substrings of s (possibly intersecting, possibly the same, possibly non-intersecting — just any two substrings). After choosing them, you calculate the value of the chosen pair of substrings as follows:  let s_1 be the first substring, s_2 be the second chosen substring, and f(s_i) be the integer such that s_i is its binary representation (for example, if s_i is 11010, f(s_i) = 26);  the value is the bitwise OR of f(s_1) and f(s_2). Calculate the maximum possible value you can get, and print it in binary representation without leading zeroes.
