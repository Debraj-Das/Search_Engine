You are given a string s. You should answer n queries. The i-th query consists of integer k_i and string m_i. The answer for this query is the minimum length of such a string t that t is a substring of s and m_i has at least k_i occurrences as a substring in t.A substring of a string is a continuous segment of characters of the string.It is guaranteed that for any two queries the strings m_i from these queries are different.
