Monocarp and Polycarp are learning new programming techniques. Now they decided to try pair programming.It's known that they have worked together on the same file for n + m minutes. Every minute exactly one of them made one change to the file. Before they started, there were already k lines written in the file.Every minute exactly one of them does one of two actions: adds a new line to the end of the file or changes one of its lines.Monocarp worked in total for n minutes and performed the sequence of actions [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]. If a_i = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If a_i > 0, then he changes the line with the number a_i. Monocarp performed actions strictly in this order: a_1, then a_2, ..., a_n.Polycarp worked in total for m minutes and performed the sequence of actions [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m]. If b_j = 0, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If b_j > 0, then he changes the line with the number b_j. Polycarp performed actions strictly in this order: b_1, then b_2, ..., b_m.Restore their common sequence of actions of length n + m such that all actions would be correct — there should be no changes to lines that do not yet exist. Keep in mind that in the common sequence Monocarp's actions should form the subsequence [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] and Polycarp's — subsequence [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m]. They can replace each other at the computer any number of times.Let's look at an example. Suppose k = 3. Monocarp first changed the line with the number 2 and then added a new line (thus, n = 2, \: a = [2, 0]). Polycarp first added a new line and then changed the line with the number 5 (thus, m = 2, \: b = [0, 5]).Since the initial length of the file was 3, in order for Polycarp to change line number 5 two new lines must be added beforehand. Examples of correct sequences of changes, in this case, would be [0, 2, 0, 5] and [2, 0, 0, 5]. Changes [0, 0, 5, 2] (wrong order of actions) and [0, 5, 2, 0] (line 5 cannot be edited yet) are not correct.
