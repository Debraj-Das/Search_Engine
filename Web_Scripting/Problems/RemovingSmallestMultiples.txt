You are given a set S, which contains the first n positive integers: 1, 2, \ldots, n.You can perform the following operation on S any number of times (possibly zero):   Choose a positive integer k where 1 \le k \le n, such that there exists a multiple of k in S. Then, delete the smallest multiple of k from S. This operation requires a cost of k. You are given a set T, which is a subset of S. Find the minimum possible total cost of operations such that S would be transformed into T. We can show that such a transformation is always possible.
