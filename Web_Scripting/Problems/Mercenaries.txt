Polycarp plays a (yet another!) strategic computer game. In this game, he leads an army of mercenaries.Polycarp wants to gather his army for a quest. There are n mercenaries for hire, and the army should consist of some subset of them.The i-th mercenary can be chosen if the resulting number of chosen mercenaries is not less than l_i (otherwise he deems the quest to be doomed) and not greater than r_i (he doesn't want to share the trophies with too many other mercenaries). Furthermore, m pairs of mercenaries hate each other and cannot be chosen for the same quest. How many non-empty subsets does Polycarp need to consider? In other words, calculate the number of non-empty subsets of mercenaries such that the size of this subset belongs to [l_i, r_i] for each chosen mercenary, and there are no two mercenaries in the subset that hate each other.The answer may be large, so calculate it modulo 998244353.
