The Travelling Salesman spends a lot of time travelling so he tends to get bored To pass time he likes to perform operations on numbers One such operation is to take a positive integer x and reduce it to the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of x For example for number 13 its true that 131011012 so it has 3 bits set and 13 will be reduced to 3 in one operationHe calls a number special if the minimum number of operations to reduce it to 1 is kHe wants to find out how many special numbers exist which are not greater than n Please help the Travelling Salesman as he is about to reach his destinationSince the answer can be large output it modulo 1097
