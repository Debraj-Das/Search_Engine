You have a deck of n cards, and you'd like to reorder it to a new one.Each card has a value between 1 and n equal to p_i. All p_i are pairwise distinct. Cards in a deck are numbered from bottom to top, i. e. p_1 stands for the bottom card, p_n is the top card. In each step you pick some integer k > 0, take the top k cards from the original deck and place them, in the order they are now, on top of the new deck. You perform this operation until the original deck is empty. (Refer to the notes section for the better understanding.)Let's define an order of a deck as \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}{n^{n - i} \cdot p_i}.Given the original deck, output the deck with maximum possible order you can make using the operation above.
