You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n consisting of n positive integers and a positive integer m.You should divide elements of this array into some arrays. You can order the elements in the new arrays as you want.Let's call an array m-divisible if for each two adjacent numbers in the array (two numbers on the positions i and i+1 are called adjacent for each i) their sum is divisible by m. An array of one element is m-divisible.Find the smallest number of m-divisible arrays that a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n is possible to divide into.
