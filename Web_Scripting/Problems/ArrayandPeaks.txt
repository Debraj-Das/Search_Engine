A sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.Given two integers n and k, construct a permutation a of numbers from 1 to n which has exactly k peaks. An index i of an array a of size n is said to be a peak if 1 < i < n and a_i \gt a_{i-1} and a_i \gt a_{i+1}. If such permutation is not possible, then print -1.
