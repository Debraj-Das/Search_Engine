On March 14, the day of the number \pi is celebrated all over the world. This is a very important mathematical constant equal to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.Polycarp was told at school that the number \pi is irrational, therefore it has an infinite number of digits in decimal notation. He wanted to prepare for the Day of the number \pi by memorizing this number as accurately as possible.Polycarp wrote out all the digits that he managed to remember. For example, if Polycarp remembered \pi as 3.1415, he wrote out 31415.Polycarp was in a hurry and could have made a mistake, so you decided to check how many first digits of the number \pi Polycarp actually remembers correctly.
