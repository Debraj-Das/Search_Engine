Little09 and his friends are playing a game. There are n players, and the temperature value of the player i is i. The types of environment are expressed as 0 or 1. When two players fight in a specific environment, if its type is 0, the player with a lower temperature value in this environment always wins; if it is 1, the player with a higher temperature value in this environment always wins. The types of the n-1 environments form a binary string s with a length of n-1.If there are x players participating in the game, there will be a total of x-1 battles, and the types of the x-1 environments will be the first x-1 characters of s. While there is more than one player left in the tournament, choose any two remaining players to fight. The player who loses will be eliminated from the tournament. The type of the environment of battle i is s_i.For each x from 2 to n, answer the following question: if all players whose temperature value does not exceed x participate in the game, how many players have a chance to win?
