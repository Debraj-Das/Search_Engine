Luca has a cypher made up of a sequence of n wheels, each with a digit a_i written on it. On the i-th wheel, he made b_i moves. Each move is one of two types:   up move (denoted by \texttt{U}): it increases the i-th digit by 1. After applying the up move on 9, it becomes 0.  down move (denoted by \texttt{D}): it decreases the i-th digit by 1. After applying the down move on 0, it becomes 9.   Example for n=4. The current sequence is 0 0 0 0. Luca knows the final sequence of wheels and the moves for each wheel. Help him find the original sequence and crack the cypher.
