There are n points and m segments on the coordinate line. The initial coordinate of the i-th point is a_i. The endpoints of the j-th segment are l_j and r_j — left and right endpoints, respectively.You can move the points. In one move you can move any point from its current coordinate x to the coordinate x - 1 or the coordinate x + 1. The cost of this move is 1.You should move the points in such a way that each segment is visited by at least one point. A point visits the segment [l, r] if there is a moment when its coordinate was on the segment [l, r] (including endpoints).You should find the minimal possible total cost of all moves such that all segments are visited.
