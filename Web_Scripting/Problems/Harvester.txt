It is Bubble Cup finals season and farmer Johnny Bubbles must harvest his bubbles. The bubbles are in a rectangular bubblefield formed of N x M square parcels divided into N rows and M columns. The parcel in i^{th} row and j^{th} column yields A_{i,j} bubbles.Johnny Bubbles has available a very special self-driving bubble harvester that, once manually positioned at the beginning of a row or column, automatically harvests all the bubbles in that row or column. Once the harvester reaches the end of the row or column it stops and must be repositioned. The harvester can pass through any parcel any number of times, but it can collect bubbles from the parcel only once.Johnny is very busy farmer, so he is available to manually position the harvester at most four times per day. Johnny is also impatient, so he wants to harvest as many bubbles as possible on the first day.Please help Johnny to calculate what is the maximum number of bubbles he can collect on the first day.
