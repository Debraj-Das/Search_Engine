Of course you have heard the famous task about Hanoi Towers but did you know that there is a special factory producing the rings for this wonderful game Once upon a time the ruler of the ancient Egypt ordered the workers of Hanoi Factory to create as high tower as possible They were not ready to serve such a strange order so they had to create this new tower using already produced ringsThere are n rings in factorys stock The ith ring has inner radius ai outer radius bi and height hi The goal is to select some subset of rings and arrange them such that the following conditions are satisfied  Outer radiuses form a nonincreasing sequence ie one can put the jth ring on the ith ring only if bjbi  Rings should not fall one into the the other That means one can place ring j on the ring i only if bjai  The total height of all rings used should be maximum possible
