Karl likes Codeforces and subsequences. He wants to find a string of lowercase English letters that contains at least k subsequences codeforces. Out of all possible strings, Karl wants to find a shortest one.Formally, a codeforces subsequence of a string s is a subset of ten characters of s that read codeforces from left to right. For example, codeforces contains codeforces a single time, while codeforcesisawesome contains codeforces four times: codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome.Help Karl find any shortest string that contains at least k codeforces subsequences.
