You are given an array a consisting of n non-negative integers. You have to choose a non-negative integer x and form a new array b of size n according to the following rule: for all i from 1 to n, b_i = a_i \oplus x (\oplus denotes the operation bitwise XOR).An inversion in the b array is a pair of integers i and j such that 1 \le i < j \le n and b_i > b_j.You should choose x in such a way that the number of inversions in b is minimized. If there are several options for x — output the smallest one.
