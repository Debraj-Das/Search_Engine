Kawashiro Nitori is a girl who loves competitive programming. One day she found a rooted tree consisting of n vertices. The root is vertex 1. As an advanced problem setter, she quickly thought of a problem.Kawashiro Nitori has a vertex set U=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}. She's going to play a game with the tree and the set. In each operation, she will choose a vertex set T, where T is a partial virtual tree of U, and change U into T.A vertex set S_1 is a partial virtual tree of a vertex set S_2, if S_1 is a subset of S_2, S_1 \neq S_2, and for all pairs of vertices i and j in S_1, \operatorname{LCA}(i,j) is in S_1, where \operatorname{LCA}(x,y) denotes the lowest common ancestor of vertices x and y on the tree. Note that a vertex set can have many different partial virtual trees.Kawashiro Nitori wants to know for each possible k, if she performs the operation exactly k times, in how many ways she can make U=\{1\} in the end? Two ways are considered different if there exists an integer z (1 \le z \le k) such that after z operations the sets U are different.Since the answer could be very large, you need to find it modulo p. It's guaranteed that p is a prime number.
