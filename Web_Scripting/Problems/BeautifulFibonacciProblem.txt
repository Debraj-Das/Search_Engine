The well-known Fibonacci sequence F_0, F_1, F_2,\ldots  is defined as follows:   F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1.  For each i \geq 2: F_i = F_{i - 1} + F_{i - 2}. Given an increasing arithmetic sequence of positive integers with n elements: (a, a + d, a + 2\cdot d,\ldots, a + (n - 1)\cdot d).You need to find another increasing arithmetic sequence of positive integers with n elements (b, b + e, b + 2\cdot e,\ldots, b + (n - 1)\cdot e) such that:  0 < b, e < 2^{64},  for all 0\leq i < n, the decimal representation of a + i \cdot d appears as substring in the last 18 digits of the decimal representation of F_{b + i \cdot e} (if this number has less than 18 digits, then we consider all its digits).
