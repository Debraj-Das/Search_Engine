A sequence is almost-increasing if it does not contain three consecutive elements x, y, z such that x\ge y\ge z.You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n and q queries.Each query consists of two integers 1\le l\le r\le n. For each query, find the length of the longest almost-increasing subsequence of the subarray a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
