Programmer Sasha is a student at MIPT Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and he needs to make a laboratory work to pass his finalsA laboratory unit is a plane with standard coordinate axes marked on it Physicists from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology charged the axes by large electric charges axis X is positive and axis Y is negativeExperienced laboratory worker marked n points with integer coordinates xiyi on the plane and stopped the time Sasha should use atomic tweezers to place elementary particles in these points He has an unlimited number of electrons negatively charged elementary particles and protons positively charged elementary particles He can put either an electron or a proton at each marked point As soon as all marked points are filled with particles laboratory worker will turn on the time again and the particles will come in motion and after some time they will stabilize in equilibrium The objective of the laboratory work is to arrange the particles in such a way that the diameter of the resulting state the maximum distance between the pairs of points of the set is as small as possibleSince Sasha is a programmer he naively thinks that all the particles will simply fall into their projections on the corresponding axes electrons will fall on axis X while protons will fall on axis Y As we are programmers too we will consider the same model as Sasha That is a particle gets from point xy to point x0 if it is an electron and to point 0y if it is a protonAs the laboratory has high background radiation and Sasha takes care of his laptop he did not take it with him and now he cant write a program that computes the minimum possible diameter of the resulting set Therefore you will have to do it for himPrint a square of the minimum possible diameter of the set
