There is an infinite 2-dimensional grid. The robot stands in cell (0, 0) and wants to reach cell (x, y). Here is a list of possible commands the robot can execute:  move north from cell (i, j) to (i, j + 1);  move east from cell (i, j) to (i + 1, j);  move south from cell (i, j) to (i, j - 1);  move west from cell (i, j) to (i - 1, j);  stay in cell (i, j). The robot wants to reach cell (x, y) in as few commands as possible. However, he can't execute the same command two or more times in a row.What is the minimum number of commands required to reach (x, y) from (0, 0)?
