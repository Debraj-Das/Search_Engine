You are given an n \times n multiplication table and a positive integer m = m_1 \cdot m_2. A n \times n multiplication table is a table with n rows and n columns numbered from 1 to n, where a_{i, j} = i \cdot j.For each divisor d of m, check: does d occur in the table at least once, and if it does, what is the minimum row that contains d.
