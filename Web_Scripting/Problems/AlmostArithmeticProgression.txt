Polycarp likes arithmetic progressions. A sequence [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n] is called an arithmetic progression if for each i (1 \le i < n) the value a_{i+1} - a_i is the same. For example, the sequences [42], [5, 5, 5], [2, 11, 20, 29] and [3, 2, 1, 0] are arithmetic progressions, but [1, 0, 1], [1, 3, 9] and [2, 3, 1] are not.It follows from the definition that any sequence of length one or two is an arithmetic progression.Polycarp found some sequence of positive integers [b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n]. He agrees to change each element by at most one. In the other words, for each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by 1, an element can be increased by 1, an element can be left unchanged.Determine a minimum possible number of elements in b which can be changed (by exactly one), so that the sequence b becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is impossible.It is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals 0.
