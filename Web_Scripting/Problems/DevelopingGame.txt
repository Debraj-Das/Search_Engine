Pavel is going to make a game of his dream. However, he knows that he can't make it on his own so he founded a development company and hired n workers of staff. Now he wants to pick n workers from the staff who will be directly responsible for developing a game.Each worker has a certain skill level vi. Besides, each worker doesn't want to work with the one whose skill is very different. In other words, the i-th worker won't work with those whose skill is less than li, and with those whose skill is more than ri.Pavel understands that the game of his dream isn't too hard to develop, so the worker with any skill will be equally useful. That's why he wants to pick a team of the maximum possible size. Help him pick such team.
