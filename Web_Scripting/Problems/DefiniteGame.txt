Chouti was doing a competitive programming competition. However, after having all the problems accepted, he got bored and decided to invent some small games.He came up with the following game. The player has a positive integer n. Initially the value of n equals to v and the player is able to do the following operation as many times as the player want (possibly zero): choose a positive integer x that x<n and x is not a divisor of n, then subtract x from n. The goal of the player is to minimize the value of n in the end.Soon, Chouti found the game trivial. Can you also beat the game?
