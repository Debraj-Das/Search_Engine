For a given array a consisting of n integers and a given integer m find if it is possible to reorder elements of the array a in such a way that \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\sum_{j=i}^{n}{\frac{a_j}{j}}} equals m? It is forbidden to delete elements as well as insert new elements. Please note that no rounding occurs during division, for example, \frac{5}{2}=2.5.
