Vasya came up with his own weather forecasting method He knows the information about the average air temperature for each of the last n days Assume that the average air temperature for each day is integralVasya believes that if the average temperatures over the last n days form an arithmetic progression where the first term equals to the average temperature on the first day the second term equals to the average temperature on the second day and so on then the average temperature of the next n1th day will be equal to the next term of the arithmetic progression Otherwise according to Vasyas method the temperature of the n1th day will be equal to the temperature of the nth dayYour task is to help Vasya predict the average temperature for tomorrow i e for the n1th day
