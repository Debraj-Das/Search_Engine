Vasya and Petya take part in a Codeforces round The round lasts for two hours and contains five problemsFor this round the dynamic problem scoring is used If you were lucky not to participate in any Codeforces round with dynamic problem scoring here is what it means The maximum point value of the problem depends on the ratio of the number of participants who solved the problem to the total number of round participants Everyone who made at least one submission is considered to be participating in the roundPay attention to the range bounds For example if 40 people are taking part in the round and 10 of them solve a particular problem then the solvers fraction is equal to 14 and the problems maximum point value is equal to 1500If the problems maximum point value is equal to x then for each whole minute passed from the beginning of the contest to the moment of the participants correct submission the participant loses x250 points For example if the problems maximum point value is 2000 and the participant submits a correct solution to it 40 minutes into the round this participant will be awarded with 20001402501680 points for this problemThere are n participants in the round including Vasya and Petya For each participant and each problem the number of minutes which passed between the beginning of the contest and the submission of this participant to this problem is known Its also possible that this participant made no submissions to this problemWith two seconds until the end of the round all participants submissions have passed pretests and not a single hack attempt has been made Vasya believes that no more submissions or hack attempts will be made in the remaining two seconds and every submission will pass the system testingUnfortunately Vasya is a cheater He has registered 1097 new accounts for the round Now Vasya can submit any of his solutions from these new accounts in order to change the maximum point values of the problems Vasya can also submit any wrong solutions to any problems Note that Vasya can not submit correct solutions to the problems he hasnt solvedVasya seeks to score strictly more points than Petya in the current round Vasya has already prepared the scripts which allow to obfuscate his solutions and submit them into the system from any of the new accounts in just fractions of seconds However Vasya doesnt want to make his cheating too obvious so he wants to achieve his goal while making submissions from the smallest possible number of new accountsFind the smallest number of new accounts Vasya needs in order to beat Petya provided that Vasyas assumptions are correct or report that Vasya cant achieve his goal
