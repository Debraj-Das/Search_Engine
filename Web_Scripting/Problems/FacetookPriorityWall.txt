Facetook is a well known social network website, and it will launch a new feature called Facetook Priority Wall. This feature will sort all posts from your friends according to the priority factor (it will be described).This priority factor will be affected by three types of actions:   1. "X posted on Y's wall" (15 points),  2. "X commented on Y's post" (10 points),  3. "X likes Y's post" (5 points). X and Y will be two distinct names. And each action will increase the priority factor between X and Y (and vice versa) by the above value of points (the priority factor between X and Y is the same as the priority factor between Y and X).You will be given n actions with the above format (without the action number and the number of points), and you have to print all the distinct names in these actions sorted according to the priority factor with you.
