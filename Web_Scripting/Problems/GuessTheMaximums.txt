This is an interactive problem.Ayush devised a new scheme to set the password of his lock. The lock has k slots where each slot can hold integers from 1 to n. The password P is a sequence of k integers each in the range [1, n], i-th element of which goes into the i-th slot of the lock.To set the password of his lock, Ayush comes up with an array A of n integers each in the range [1, n] (not necessarily distinct). He then picks k non-empty mutually disjoint subsets of indices S_1, S_2, ..., S_k (S_i \underset{i \neq j} \cap S_j = \emptyset) and sets his password as P_i = \max\limits_{j \notin S_i} A[j]. In other words, the i-th integer in the password is equal to the maximum over all elements of A whose indices do not belong to S_i.You are given the subsets of indices chosen by Ayush. You need to guess the password. To make a query, you can choose a non-empty subset of indices of the array and ask the maximum of all elements of the array with index in this subset. You can ask no more than 12 queries.
