Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time.— Terry Pratchett, Hogfather, DiscworldYou are given a string s of length n and a number k. Let's denote by rev(s) the reversed string s (i.e. rev(s) = s_n s_{n-1} ... s_1). You can apply one of the two kinds of operations to the string: replace the string s with s + rev(s) replace the string s with rev(s) + sHow many different strings can you get as a result of performing exactly k operations (possibly of different kinds) on the original string s?In this statement we denoted the concatenation of strings s and t as s + t. In other words, s + t = s_1 s_2 ... s_n t_1 t_2 ... t_m, where n and m are the lengths of strings s and t respectively.
