You are given an array a consisting of n integers.In one move, you can choose some index i (1 \le i \le n - 2) and shift the segment [a_i, a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2}] cyclically to the right (i.e. replace the segment [a_i, a_{i + 1}, a_{i + 2}] with [a_{i + 2}, a_i, a_{i + 1}]). Your task is to sort the initial array by no more than n^2 such operations or say that it is impossible to do that.You have to answer t independent test cases.
