Ostap is preparing to play chess again and this time he is about to prepare. Thus, he was closely monitoring one recent chess tournament. There were m players participating and each pair of players played exactly one game. The victory gives 2 points, draw — 1 points, lose — 0 points.Ostap is lazy, so he never tries to remember the outcome of each game. Instead, he computes the total number of points earned by each of the players (the sum of his points in all games which he took part in), sort these value in non-ascending order and then remembers first n integers in this list.Now the Great Strategist Ostap wonders whether he remembers everything correct. He considers that he is correct if there exists at least one tournament results table such that it will produce the given integers. That means, if we count the sum of points for each player, sort them and take first n elements, the result will coincide with what Ostap remembers. Can you check if such table exists?
