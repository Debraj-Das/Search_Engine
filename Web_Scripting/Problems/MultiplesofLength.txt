You are given an array a of n integers.You want to make all elements of a equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:  Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of len to it, where len is the length of this segment (added integers can be different). It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of a equal to zero.
