There are n kids, numbered from 1 to n, dancing in a circle around the Christmas tree. Let's enumerate them in a clockwise direction as p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (all these numbers are from 1 to n and are distinct, so p is a permutation). Let the next kid for a kid p_i be kid p_{i + 1} if i < n and p_1 otherwise. After the dance, each kid remembered two kids: the next kid (let's call him x) and the next kid for x. Each kid told you which kids he/she remembered: the kid i remembered kids a_{i, 1} and a_{i, 2}. However, the order of a_{i, 1} and a_{i, 2} can differ from their order in the circle.  Example: 5 kids in a circle, p=[3, 2, 4, 1, 5] (or any cyclic shift). The information kids remembered is: a_{1,1}=3, a_{1,2}=5; a_{2,1}=1, a_{2,2}=4; a_{3,1}=2, a_{3,2}=4; a_{4,1}=1, a_{4,2}=5; a_{5,1}=2, a_{5,2}=3. You have to restore the order of the kids in the circle using this information. If there are several answers, you may print any. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.If you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.
