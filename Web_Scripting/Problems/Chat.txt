There are times you recall a good old friend and everything you've come through together. Luckily there are social networks — they store all your message history making it easy to know what you argued over 10 years ago.More formal, your message history is a sequence of messages ordered by time sent numbered from 1 to n where n is the total number of messages in the chat.Each message might contain a link to an earlier message which it is a reply to. When opening a message x or getting a link to it, the dialogue is shown in such a way that k previous messages, message x and k next messages are visible (with respect to message x). In case there are less than k messages somewhere, they are yet all shown.Digging deep into your message history, you always read all visible messages and then go by the link in the current message x (if there is one) and continue reading in the same manner.Determine the number of messages you'll read if your start from message number t for all t from 1 to n. Calculate these numbers independently. If you start with message x, the initial configuration is x itself, k previous and k next messages. Messages read multiple times are considered as one.
