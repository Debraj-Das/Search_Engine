Given an array a of length n, you can do at most k operations of the following type on it:  choose 2 different elements in the array, add 1 to the first, and subtract 1 from the second. However, all the elements of a have to remain non-negative after this operation. What is lexicographically the smallest array you can obtain?An array x is lexicographically smaller than an array y if there exists an index i such that x_i<y_i, and x_j=y_j for all 1 \le j < i. Less formally, at the first index i in which they differ, x_i<y_i.
