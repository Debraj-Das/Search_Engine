The position of the leftmost maximum on the segment [l; r] of array x = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n] is the smallest integer i such that l \le i \le r and x_i = \max(x_l, x_{l+1}, \ldots, x_r).You are given an array a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] of length n. Find the number of integer arrays b = [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n] of length n that satisfy the following conditions:   1 \le b_i \le m for all 1 \le i \le n;  for all pairs of integers 1 \le l \le r \le n, the position of the leftmost maximum on the segment [l; r] of the array b is equal to the position of the leftmost maximum on the segment [l; r] of the array a. Since the answer might be very large, print its remainder modulo 10^9+7.
