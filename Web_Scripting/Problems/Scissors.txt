Jenya has recently acquired quite a useful tool — k-scissors for cutting strings. They are generally used for cutting out two non-intersecting substrings of length k from an arbitrary string s (its length should be at least 2·k in order to perform this operation) and concatenating them afterwards (preserving the initial order). For example, with the help of 2-scissors you can cut ab and de out of abcde and concatenate them into abde, but not ab and bc since they're intersecting.It's a nice idea to test this tool before using it in practice. After looking through the papers, Jenya came up with two strings s and t. His question is whether it is possible to apply his scissors to string s such that the resulting concatenation contains t as a substring?
