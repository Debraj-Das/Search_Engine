You are given an array a consisting of n integers.Your task is to determine if a has some subsequence of length at least 3 that is a palindrome.Recall that an array b is called a subsequence of the array a if b can be obtained by removing some (possibly, zero) elements from a (not necessarily consecutive) without changing the order of remaining elements. For example, [2], [1, 2, 1, 3] and [2, 3] are subsequences of [1, 2, 1, 3], but [1, 1, 2] and [4] are not.Also, recall that a palindrome is an array that reads the same backward as forward. In other words, the array a of length n is the palindrome if a_i = a_{n - i - 1} for all i from 1 to n. For example, arrays [1234], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1] and [10, 100, 10] are palindromes, but arrays [1, 2] and [1, 2, 3, 1] are not.You have to answer t independent test cases.
