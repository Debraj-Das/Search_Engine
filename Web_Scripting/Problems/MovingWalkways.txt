Airports often use moving walkways to help you walking big distances faster. Each such walkway has some speed that effectively increases your speed. You can stand on such a walkway and let it move you, or you could also walk and then your effective speed is your walking speed plus walkway's speed.Limak wants to get from point 0 to point L on a straight line. There are n disjoint walkways in between. The i-th walkway is described by two integers x_i and y_i and a real value s_i. The i-th walkway starts at x_i, ends at y_i and has speed s_i. Every walkway is located inside the segment [0, L] and no two walkways have positive intersection. However, they can touch by endpoints.Limak needs to decide how to distribute his energy. For example, it might make more sense to stand somewhere (or to walk slowly) to then have a lot of energy to walk faster.Limak's initial energy is 0 and it must never drop below that value. At any moment, he can walk with any speed v in the interval [0, 2] and it will cost him v energy per second, but he continuously recovers energy with speed of 1 energy per second. So, when he walks with speed v, his energy increases by (1-v). Note that negative value would mean losing energy.In particular, he can walk with speed 1 and this won't change his energy at all, while walking with speed 0.77 effectively gives him 0.23 energy per second.Limak can choose his speed arbitrarily (any real value in interval [0, 2]) at every moment of time (including the moments when he is located on non-integer positions). Everything is continuous (non-discrete).What is the fastest time Limak can get from 0 to L?
