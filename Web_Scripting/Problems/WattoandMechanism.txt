Watto, the owner of a spare parts store, has recently got an order for the mechanism that can process strings in a certain way. Initially the memory of the mechanism is filled with n strings. Then the mechanism should be able to process queries of the following type: "Given string s, determine if the memory of the mechanism contains string t that consists of the same number of characters as s and differs from s in exactly one position".Watto has already compiled the mechanism, all that's left is to write a program for it and check it on the data consisting of n initial lines and m queries. He decided to entrust this job to you.
