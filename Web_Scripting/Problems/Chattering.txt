There are n parrots standing in a circle. Each parrot has a certain level of respect among other parrots, namely r_i. When a parrot with respect level x starts chattering, x neighbours to the right and to the left of it start repeating the same words in 1 second. Their neighbours then start repeating as well, and so on, until all the birds begin to chatter.You are given the respect levels of all parrots. For each parrot answer a question: if this certain parrot starts chattering, how many seconds will pass until all other birds will start repeating it?
