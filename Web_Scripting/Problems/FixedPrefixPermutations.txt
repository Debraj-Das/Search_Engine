You are given n permutations a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, each of length m. Recall that a permutation of length m is a sequence of m distinct integers from 1 to m.Let the beauty of a permutation p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m be the largest k such that p_1 = 1, p_2 = 2, \dots, p_k = k. If p_1 \neq 1, then the beauty is 0.The product of two permutations p \cdot q is a permutation r such that r_j = q_{p_j}.For each i from 1 to n, print the largest beauty of a permutation a_i \cdot a_j over all j from 1 to n (possibly, i = j).
