You are given two matrices A and B. Each matrix contains exactly n rows and m columns. Each element of A is either 0 or 1; each element of B is initially 0.You may perform some operations with matrix B. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of B having size 2 \times 2, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with 1. In other words, you choose two integers x and y such that 1 \le x < n and 1 \le y < m, and then set B_{x, y}, B_{x, y + 1}, B_{x + 1, y} and B_{x + 1, y + 1} to 1.Your goal is to make matrix B equal to matrix A. Two matrices A and B are equal if and only if every element of matrix A is equal to the corresponding element of matrix B.Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes B equal to A. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.
