Tomash keeps wandering off and getting lost while he is walking along the streets of Berland Its no surprise In his home town for any pair of intersections there is exactly one way to walk from one intersection to the other one The capital of Berland is very differentTomash has noticed that even simple cases of ambiguity confuse him So when he sees a group of four distinct intersections a b c and d such that there are two paths from a to c  one through b and the other one through d he calls the group a damn rhombus Note that pairs ab bc ad dc should be directly connected by the roads Schematically a damn rhombus is shown on the figure below  Other roads between any of the intersections dont make the rhombus any more appealing to Tomash so the four intersections remain a damn rhombus for himGiven that the capital of Berland has n intersections and m roads and all roads are unidirectional and are known in advance find the number of damn rhombi in the cityWhen rhombi are compared the order of intersections b and d doesnt matter
