You have been invited as a production process optimization specialist to some very large company. The company has n machines at its factory, standing one behind another in the production chain. Each machine can be described in one of the following two ways: (+,~a_i) or (*,~a_i).If a workpiece with the value x is supplied to the machine of kind (+,~a_i), then the output workpiece has value x + a_i.If a workpiece with the value x is supplied to the machine of kind (*,~a_i), then the output workpiece has value x \cdot a_i.The whole production process is as follows. The workpiece with the value 1 is supplied to the first machine, then the workpiece obtained after the operation of the first machine is supplied to the second machine, then the workpiece obtained after the operation of the second machine is supplied to the third machine, and so on. The company is not doing very well, so now the value of the resulting product does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9.The directors of the company are not satisfied with the efficiency of the production process and have given you a budget of b coins to optimize it.To optimize production you can change the order of machines in the chain. Namely, by spending p coins, you can take any machine of kind (+,~a_i) and move it to any place in the chain without changing the order of other machines. Also, by spending m coins, you can take any machine of kind (*,~a_i) and move it to any place in the chain.What is the maximum value of the resulting product that can be achieved if the total cost of movements that are made should not exceed b coins?
