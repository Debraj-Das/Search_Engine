One day mum asked Petya to sort his toys and get rid of some of them Petya found a whole box of toy spiders They were quite dear to him and the boy didnt want to throw them away Petya conjured a cunning plan he will glue all the spiders together and attach them to the ceiling Besides Petya knows that the lower the spiders will hang the more mum is going to like it and then she wont throw his favourite toys away Help Petya carry out the planA spider consists of k beads tied together by k1 threads Each thread connects two different beads at that any pair of beads that make up a spider is either directly connected by a thread or is connected via some chain of threads and beadsPetya may glue spiders together directly gluing their beads The length of each thread equals 1 The sizes of the beads can be neglected Thats why we can consider that gluing spiders happens by identifying some of the beads see the picture Besides the construction resulting from the gluing process should also represent a spider that is it should have the given features After Petya glues all spiders together he measures the length of the resulting toy The distance between a pair of beads is identified as the total length of the threads that connect these two beads The length of the resulting construction is the largest distance between all pairs of beads Petya wants to make the spider whose length is as much as possible    The picture two shows two spiders from the second sample We can glue to the bead number 2 of the first spider the bead number 1 of the second spider The threads in the spiders that form the sequence of threads of maximum lengths are highlighted on the picture
