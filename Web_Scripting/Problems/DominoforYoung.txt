You are given a Young diagram. Given diagram is a histogram with n columns of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \ldots \geq a_n \geq 1).  Young diagram for a=[3,2,2,2,1]. Your goal is to find the largest number of non-overlapping dominos that you can draw inside of this histogram, a domino is a 1 \times 2 or 2 \times 1 rectangle.
