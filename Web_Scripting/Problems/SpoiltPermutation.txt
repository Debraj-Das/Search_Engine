Vasya collects coins he has exactly one coin for every year from 1 to n Naturally Vasya keeps all the coins in his collection in the order in which they were released Once Vasyas younger brother made a change  he took all the coins whose release year dated from l to r inclusively and put them in the reverse order That is he took a certain segment lr and reversed it At that the segments endpoints did not coincide For example if n8 then initially Vasyas coins were kept in the order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 If Vasyas younger brother chose the segment 26 then after the reversal the coin order will change to 1 6 5 4 3 2 7 8 Vasya suspects that someone else could have spoilt the permutation after his brother Help him to find that out Check if the given permutation can be obtained from the permutation 1 2  n using exactly one segment reversal If it is possible find the segment itself
