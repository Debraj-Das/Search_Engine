Vasya got really tired of these credits (from problem F) and now wants to earn the money himself! He decided to make a contest to gain a profit.Vasya has n problems to choose from. They are numbered from 1 to n. The difficulty of the i-th problem is d_i. Moreover, the problems are given in the increasing order by their difficulties. The difficulties of all tasks are pairwise distinct. In order to add the i-th problem to the contest you need to pay c_i burles to its author. For each problem in the contest Vasya gets a burles.In order to create a contest he needs to choose a consecutive subsegment of tasks.So the total earnings for the contest are calculated as follows:   if Vasya takes problem i to the contest, he needs to pay c_i to its author;  for each problem in the contest Vasya gets a burles;  let gap(l, r) = \max\limits_{l \le i < r} (d_{i + 1} - d_i)^2. If Vasya takes all the tasks with indices from l to r to the contest, he also needs to pay gap(l, r). If l = r then gap(l, r) = 0. Calculate the maximum profit that Vasya can earn by taking a consecutive segment of tasks.
