Cool J has recently become a businessman Mr Jackson and he has to make a lot of phone calls now Today he has n calls planned For each call we know the moment ti in seconds since the start of the day when it is scheduled to start and its duration di in seconds All ti are different Mr Jackson is a very important person so he never dials anybody himself all calls will be incomingMr Jackson isnt Caesar and he cant do several things at once If somebody calls him while he hasnt finished the previous conversation Mr Jackson puts the new call on hold in the queue In this case immediately after the end of the current call Mr Jackson takes the earliest incoming call from the queue and starts the conversation If Mr Jackson started the call at the second t and the call continues for d seconds then Mr Jackson is busy at seconds tt1td1 and he can start a new call at second td Note that if Mr Jackson is not busy talking when somebody calls he cant put this call on holdMr Jackson isnt Napoleon either he likes to sleep So sometimes he allows himself the luxury of ignoring a call as if it never was scheduled He can ignore at most k calls Note that a call which comes while he is busy talking can be ignored as wellWhat is the maximum number of seconds Mr Jackson can sleep today assuming that he can choose an arbitrary continuous time segment from the current day that is with seconds from the 1st to the 86400th inclusive when he is not busy talkingNote that some calls can be continued or postponed to the next day or even later However the interval for sleep should be completely within the current day
