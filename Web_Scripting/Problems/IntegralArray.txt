You are given an array a of n positive integers numbered from 1 to n. Let's call an array integral if for any two, not necessarily different, numbers x and y from this array, x \ge y, the number \left \lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right \rfloor (x divided by y with rounding down) is also in this array.You are guaranteed that all numbers in a do not exceed c. Your task is to check whether this array is integral.
