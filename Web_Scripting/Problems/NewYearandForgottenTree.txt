A tree is a connected undirected graph with n1 edges where n denotes the number of vertices Vertices are numbered 1 through nLimak is a little polar bear His bear family prepares a New Year tree every year One year ago their tree was more awesome than usually Thus they decided to prepare the same tree in the next year Limak was responsible for remembering that treeIt would be hard to remember a whole tree Limak decided to describe it in his notebook instead He took a pen and wrote n1 lines each with two integers indices of two vertices connected by an edgeNow the New Year is just around the corner and Limak is asked to reconstruct that tree Of course there is a problem He was a very little bear a year ago and he didnt know digits and the alphabet so he just replaced each digit with a question mark the only character he knew That means for any vertex index in his notes he knows only the number of digits in it At least he knows there were no leading zeroesLimak doesnt want to disappoint everyone Please take his notes and reconstruct a New Year tree Find any tree matching Limaks records and print its edges in any order Its also possible that Limak made a mistake and there is no suitable tree in this case print 1 without the quotes
