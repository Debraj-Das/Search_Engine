XYMXYM and CQXYM will prepare n problems for Codeforces. The difficulty of the problem i will be an integer a_i, where a_i \geq 0. The difficulty of the problems must satisfy a_i+a_{i+1}<m (1 \leq i < n), and a_1+a_n<m, where m is a fixed integer. XYMXYM wants to know how many plans of the difficulty of the problems there are modulo 998\,244\,353.Two plans of difficulty a and b are different only if there is an integer i (1 \leq i \leq n) satisfying a_i \neq b_i.
