For an array c of nonnegative integers, MEX(c) denotes the smallest nonnegative integer that doesn't appear in it. For example, MEX([0, 1, 3]) = 2, MEX([42]) = 0.You are given integers n, k, and an array [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n].Find the number of arrays [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n], for which the following conditions hold:0 \le a_i \le n for each i for each i from 1 to n.|MEX([a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i]) - b_i| \le k for each i from 1 to n.As this number can be very big, output it modulo 998\,244\,353.
