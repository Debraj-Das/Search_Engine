Alina has a bracket sequence s of length 2n, consisting of n opening brackets '(' and n closing brackets ')'. As she likes balance, she wants to turn this bracket sequence into a balanced bracket sequence.In one operation, she can reverse any substring of s.What's the smallest number of operations that she needs to turn s into a balanced bracket sequence? It can be shown that it's always possible in at most n operations.As a reminder, a sequence of brackets is called balanced if one can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters + and 1. For example, sequences (())(), (), and (()(())) are balanced, while )(, ((), and (()))( are not.
