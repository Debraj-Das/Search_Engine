Vasily the Bear loves beautiful strings String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1 at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times and character 1 must occur exactly m times  We can obtain character g from string s with some possibly zero number of modifications The character g equals either zero or one A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character This character equals one if it replaces two zeros otherwise it equals zero For example one modification transforms string 01010 into string 0100 two modifications transform it to 011 It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than twoHelp the Bear count the number of beautiful strings As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 1097
