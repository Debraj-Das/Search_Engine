You are given an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):   Choose any index i and set a_i to any integer (positive, negative or 0). What is the minimum number of operations needed to turn a into an arithmetic progression? The array a is an arithmetic progression if a_{i+1}-a_i=a_i-a_{i-1} for any 2 \leq i \leq n-1.
