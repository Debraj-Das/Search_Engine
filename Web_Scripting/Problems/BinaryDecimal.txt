Let's call a number a binary decimal if it's a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either 0 or 1. For example, 1\,010\,111 is a binary decimal, while 10\,201 and 787\,788 are not.Given a number n, you are asked to represent n as a sum of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals. Compute the smallest number of binary decimals required for that.
