Alice and Bob are playing a game on a graph. They have an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. All vertices of the graph have degree equal to 2. The graph may consist of several components. Note that if such graph has n vertices, it will have exactly n edges.Alice and Bob take turn. Alice goes first. In each turn, the player can choose k (l \le k \le r; l < r) vertices that form a connected subgraph and erase these vertices from the graph, including all incident edges.The player who can't make a step loses.For example, suppose they are playing on the given graph with given l = 2 and r = 3:  A valid vertex set for Alice to choose at the first move is one of the following:   \{1, 2\}  \{1, 3\}  \{2, 3\}  \{4, 5\}  \{4, 6\}  \{5, 6\}  \{1, 2, 3\}  \{4, 5, 6\}  Suppose, Alice chooses subgraph \{4, 6\}.Then a valid vertex set for Bob to choose at the first move is one of the following:   \{1, 2\}  \{1, 3\}  \{2, 3\}  \{1, 2, 3\}  Suppose, Bob chooses subgraph \{1, 2, 3\}.Alice can't make a move, so she loses.You are given a graph of size n and integers l and r. Who will win if both Alice and Bob play optimally.
