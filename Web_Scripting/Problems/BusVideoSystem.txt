The busses in Berland are equipped with a video surveillance system. The system records information about changes in the number of passengers in a bus after stops.If x is the number of passengers in a bus just before the current bus stop and y is the number of passengers in the bus just after current bus stop, the system records the number y-x. So the system records show how number of passengers changed.The test run was made for single bus and n bus stops. Thus, the system recorded the sequence of integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (exactly one number for each bus stop), where a_i is the record for the bus stop i. The bus stops are numbered from 1 to n in chronological order.Determine the number of possible ways how many people could be in the bus before the first bus stop, if the bus has a capacity equals to w (that is, at any time in the bus there should be from 0 to w passengers inclusive).
