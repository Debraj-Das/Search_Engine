Life in Bertown has become hard The city has too many roads and the government spends too much to maintain them There are n junctions and m two way roads at which one can get from each junction to any other one The mayor wants to close some roads so that the number of roads left totaled to n1 roads and it were still possible to get from each junction to any other one Besides the mayor is concerned with the number of dead ends which are the junctions from which only one road goes There shouldnt be too many or too few junctions Having discussed the problem the mayor and his assistants decided that after the roads are closed the road map should contain exactly k dead ends Your task is to count the number of different ways of closing the roads at which the following conditions are met   There are exactly n1 roads left  It is possible to get from each junction to any other one  There are exactly k dead ends on the resulting map Two ways are considered different if there is a road that is closed in the first way and is open in the second one
