Polycarp was given a row of tiles. Each tile contains one lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. The entire sequence of tiles forms the string s.In other words, you are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters.Initially, Polycarp is on the first tile of the row and wants to get to the last tile by jumping on the tiles. Jumping from i-th tile to j-th tile has a cost equal to |index(s_i) - index(s_j)|, where index(c) is the index of the letter c in the alphabet (for example, index('a')=1, index('b')=2, ..., index('z')=26) .Polycarp wants to get to the n-th tile for the minimum total cost, but at the same time make maximum number of jumps.In other words, among all possible ways to get to the last tile for the minimum total cost, he will choose the one with the maximum number of jumps.Polycarp can visit each tile at most once.Polycarp asks you to help — print the sequence of indices of string s on which he should jump.
