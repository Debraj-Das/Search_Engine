Lets define a forest as a nondirected acyclic graph also without loops and parallel edges One day Misha played with the forest consisting of n vertices For each vertex v from 0 to n1 he wrote down two integers degreev and sv were the first integer is the number of vertices adjacent to vertex v and the second integer is the XOR sum of the numbers of vertices adjacent to v if there were no adjacent vertices he wrote down 0 Next day Misha couldnt remember what graph he initially had Misha has values degreev and sv left though Help him find the number of edges and the edges of the initial graph It is guaranteed that there exists a forest that corresponds to the numbers written by Misha
