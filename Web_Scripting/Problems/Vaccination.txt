Ethan runs a vaccination station to help people combat the seasonal flu. He analyses the historical data in order to develop an optimal strategy for vaccine usage.Consider there are n patients coming to the station on a particular day. The i-th patient comes at the moment t_i. We know that each of these patients can be asked to wait for no more than w time moments. That means the i-th patient can get vaccine at moments t_i, t_i + 1, \ldots, t_i + w.Vaccines come in packs, each pack consists of k doses. Each patient needs exactly one dose. Packs are stored in a special fridge. After a pack is taken out of the fridge and opened, it can no longer be put back. The lifetime of the vaccine outside the fridge is d moments of time. Thus, if the pack was taken out of the fridge and opened at moment x, its doses can be used to vaccinate patients at moments x, x + 1, \ldots, x + d. At moment x + d + 1 all the remaining unused doses of this pack are thrown away.Assume that the vaccination station has enough staff to conduct an arbitrary number of operations at every moment of time. What is the minimum number of vaccine packs required to vaccinate all n patients?
