Alice and Bob have decided to play the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". The game consists of several rounds, each round is independent of each other. In each round, both players show one of the following things at the same time: rock, paper or scissors. If both players showed the same things then the round outcome is a draw. Otherwise, the following rules applied:  if one player showed rock and the other one showed scissors, then the player who showed rock is considered the winner and the other one is considered the loser;  if one player showed scissors and the other one showed paper, then the player who showed scissors is considered the winner and the other one is considered the loser;  if one player showed paper and the other one showed rock, then the player who showed paper is considered the winner and the other one is considered the loser. Alice and Bob decided to play exactly n rounds of the game described above. Alice decided to show rock a_1 times, show scissors a_2 times and show paper a_3 times. Bob decided to show rock b_1 times, show scissors b_2 times and show paper b_3 times. Though, both Alice and Bob did not choose the sequence in which they show things. It is guaranteed that a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = n and b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = n.Your task is to find two numbers:  the minimum number of round Alice can win;  the maximum number of rounds Alice can win.
