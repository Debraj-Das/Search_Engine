Chouti was tired of the tedious homework, so he opened up an old programming problem he created years ago.You are given a connected undirected graph with n vertices and m weighted edges. There are k special vertices: x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k.Let's define the cost of the path as the maximum weight of the edges in it. And the distance between two vertexes as the minimum cost of the paths connecting them.For each special vertex, find another special vertex which is farthest from it (in terms of the previous paragraph, i.e. the corresponding distance is maximum possible) and output the distance between them.The original constraints are really small so he thought the problem was boring. Now, he raises the constraints and hopes you can solve it for him.
