This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is maximum value of a_i.Once in Kostomuksha Divan found an array a consisting of positive integers. Now he wants to reorder the elements of a to maximize the value of the following function: \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{gcd}(a_1, \, a_2, \, \dots, \, a_i), where \operatorname{gcd}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k) denotes the greatest common divisor of integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k, and \operatorname{gcd}(x) = x for any integer x.Reordering elements of an array means changing the order of elements in the array arbitrary, or leaving the initial order.Of course, Divan can solve this problem. However, he found it interesting, so he decided to share it with you.
