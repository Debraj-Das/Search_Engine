Greatest common divisor GCDab of two positive integers a and b is equal to the biggest integer d such that both integers a and b are divisible by d There are many efficient algorithms to find greatest common divisor GCDab for example Euclid algorithm Formally find the biggest integer d such that all integers aa1a2b are divisible by d To make the problem even more complicated we allow a and b to be up to googol 10100 such number do not fit even in 64bit integer type
