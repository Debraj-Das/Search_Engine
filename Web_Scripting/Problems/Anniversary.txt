There are less than 60 years left till the 900th birthday anniversary of a famous Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci Of course such important anniversary needs much preparationsDima is sure that itll be great to learn to solve the following problem by the Big Day Youre given a set A consisting of numbers l l1 l2  r lets consider all its kelement subsets for each such subset lets find the largest common divisor of Fibonacci numbers with indexes determined by the subset elements Among all found common divisors Dima is interested in the largest oneDima asked to remind you that Fibonacci numbers are elements of a numeric sequence where F11 F21 FnFn1Fn2 for n3Dima has more than half a century ahead to solve the given task but you only have two hours Count the residue from dividing the sought largest common divisor by m
