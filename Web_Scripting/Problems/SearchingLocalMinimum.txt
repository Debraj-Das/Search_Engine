This is an interactive problem.Homer likes arrays a lot and he wants to play a game with you. Homer has hidden from you a permutation a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n of integers 1 to n. You are asked to find any index k (1 \leq k \leq n) which is a local minimum. For an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, an index i (1 \leq i \leq n) is said to be a local minimum if a_i < \min\{a_{i-1},a_{i+1}\}, where a_0 = a_{n+1} = +\infty. An array is said to be a permutation of integers 1 to n, if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.Initially, you are only given the value of n without any other information about this permutation.At each interactive step, you are allowed to choose any i (1 \leq i \leq n) and make a query with it. As a response, you will be given the value of a_i. You are asked to find any index k which is a local minimum after at most 100 queries.
