Today is Matveys birthday He never knows what to ask as a present so friends gave him a string s of length n This string consists of only first eight English letters a b  hFirst question that comes to mind is who might ever need some string Matvey is a special boy so he instantly found what to do with this string He used it to build an undirected graph where vertices correspond to position in the string and there is an edge between distinct positions a and b 1abn if at least one of the following conditions hold   a and b are neighbouring ie ab1  Positions a and b contain equal characters ie sasb Then Matvey decided to find the diameter of this graph Diameter is a maximum distance length of the shortest path among all pairs of vertices Also Matvey wants to find the number of pairs of vertices such that the distance between them is equal to the diameter of the graph As he is very cool and experienced programmer he managed to solve this problem very fast Will you do the same
