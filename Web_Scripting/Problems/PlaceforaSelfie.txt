The universe is a coordinate plane. There are n space highways, each of which is a straight line y=kx passing through the origin (0, 0). Also, there are m asteroid belts on the plane, which we represent as open upwards parabolas, i. e. graphs of functions y=ax^2+bx+c, where a > 0.You want to photograph each parabola. To do this, for each parabola you need to choose a line that does not intersect this parabola and does not touch it. You can select the same line for different parabolas. Please find such a line for each parabola, or determine that there is no such line.
