This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version q=1. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.Zookeeper has been teaching his q sheep how to write and how to add. The i-th sheep has to write exactly k non-negative integers with the sum n_i.Strangely, sheep have superstitions about digits and believe that the digits 3, 6, and 9 are lucky. To them, the fortune of a number depends on the decimal representation of the number; the fortune of a number is equal to the sum of fortunes of its digits, and the fortune of a digit depends on its value and position and can be described by the following table. For example, the number 319 has fortune F_{2} + 3F_{0}.   Each sheep wants to maximize the sum of fortune among all its k written integers. Can you help them?
