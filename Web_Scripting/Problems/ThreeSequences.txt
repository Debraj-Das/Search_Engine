You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n.You have to construct two sequences of integers b and c with length n that satisfy:  for every i (1\leq i\leq n) b_i+c_i=a_i  b is non-decreasing, which means that for every 1<i\leq n, b_i\geq b_{i-1} must hold  c is non-increasing, which means that for every 1<i\leq n, c_i\leq c_{i-1} must hold You have to minimize \max(b_i,c_i). In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences b and c.Also there will be q changes, the i-th change is described by three integers l,r,x. You should add x to a_l,a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r. You have to find the minimum possible value of \max(b_i,c_i) for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.
