Bit Lightyear, to the ANDfinity and beyond!After graduating from computer sciences, Vlad has been awarded an array a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n of n non-negative integers. As it is natural, he wanted to construct a graph consisting of n vertices, numbered 1, 2,\ldots, n. He decided to add an edge between i and j if and only if a_i \& a_j > 0, where \& denotes the bitwise AND operation.Vlad also wants the graph to be connected, which might not be the case initially. In order to satisfy that, he can do the following two types of operations on the array:  Choose some element a_i and increment it by 1.  Choose some element a_i and decrement it by 1 (possible only if a_i > 0). It can be proven that there exists a finite sequence of operations such that the graph will be connected. So, can you please help Vlad find the minimum possible number of operations to do that and also provide the way how to do that?
