For the multiset of positive integers s=\{s_1,s_2,\dots,s_k\}, define the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of s as follow: \gcd(s) is the maximum positive integer x, such that all integers in s are divisible on x. \textrm{lcm}(s) is the minimum positive integer x, that divisible on all integers from s.For example, \gcd(\{8,12\})=4,\gcd(\{12,18,6\})=6 and \textrm{lcm}(\{4,6\})=12. Note that for any positive integer x, \gcd(\{x\})=\textrm{lcm}(\{x\})=x.Orac has a sequence a with length n. He come up with the multiset t=\{\textrm{lcm}(\{a_i,a_j\})\ |\ i<j\}, and asked you to find the value of \gcd(t) for him. In other words, you need to calculate the GCD of LCMs of all pairs of elements in the given sequence.
