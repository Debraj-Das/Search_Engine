A number is ternary if it contains only digits 0, 1 and 2. For example, the following numbers are ternary: 1022, 11, 21, 2002.You are given a long ternary number x. The first (leftmost) digit of x is guaranteed to be 2, the other digits of x can be 0, 1 or 2.Let's define the ternary XOR operation \odot of two ternary numbers a and b (both of length n) as a number c = a \odot b of length n, where c_i = (a_i + b_i) \% 3 (where \% is modulo operation). In other words, add the corresponding digits and take the remainders of the sums when divided by 3. For example, 10222 \odot 11021 = 21210.Your task is to find such ternary numbers a and b both of length n and both without leading zeros that a \odot b = x and max(a, b) is the minimum possible.You have to answer t independent test cases.
