You are given two arrays a and b, both consisting of n integers.In one move, you can choose two indices i and j (1 \le i, j \le n; i \neq j) and swap a_i with a_j and b_i with b_j. You have to perform the swap in both arrays.You are allowed to perform at most 10^4 moves (possibly, zero). Can you make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order at the end? If you can, print any sequence of moves that makes both arrays sorted.
