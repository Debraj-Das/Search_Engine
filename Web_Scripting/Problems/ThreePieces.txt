You stumbled upon a new kind of chess puzzles. The chessboard you are given is not necesserily 8 \times 8, but it still is N \times N. Each square has some number written on it, all the numbers are from 1 to N^2 and all the numbers are pairwise distinct. The j-th square in the i-th row has a number A_{ij} written on it.In your chess set you have only three pieces: a knight, a bishop and a rook. At first, you put one of them on the square with the number 1 (you can choose which one). Then you want to reach square 2 (possibly passing through some other squares in process), then square 3 and so on until you reach square N^2. In one step you are allowed to either make a valid move with the current piece or replace it with some other piece. Each square can be visited arbitrary number of times.A knight can move to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. A bishop moves diagonally. A rook moves horizontally or vertically. The move should be performed to a different square from the one a piece is currently standing on.You want to minimize the number of steps of the whole traversal. Among all the paths to have the same number of steps you want to choose the one with the lowest number of piece replacements.What is the path you should take to satisfy all conditions?
