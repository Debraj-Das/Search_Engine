INTERCAL is the oldest of esoteric programming languages. One of its many weird features is the method of character-based output, known as Turing Tape method. It converts an array of unsigned 8-bit integers into a sequence of characters to print, using the following method.The integers of the array are processed one by one, starting from the first. Processing i-th element of the array is done in three steps:1. The 8-bit binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous printed character is reversed. When the first element of the array is processed, the result of this step is considered to be 0.2. The i-th element of the array is subtracted from the result of the previous step modulo 256.3. The binary notation of the result of the previous step is reversed again to produce ASCII-code of the i-th character to be printed.You are given the text printed using this method. Restore the array used to produce this text.
