Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. It is guaranteed that all the values are integer powers of 2 (i.e. a_i = 2^d for some non-negative integer number d).Polycarp wants to know answers on q queries. The j-th query is described as integer number b_j. The answer to the query is the minimum number of coins that is necessary to obtain the value b_j using some subset of coins (Polycarp can use only coins he has). If Polycarp can't obtain the value b_j, the answer to the j-th query is -1.The queries are independent (the answer on the query doesn't affect Polycarp's coins).
