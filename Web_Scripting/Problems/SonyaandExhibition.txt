Sonya decided to organize an exhibition of flowers. Since the girl likes only roses and lilies, she decided that only these two kinds of flowers should be in this exhibition.There are n flowers in a row in the exhibition. Sonya can put either a rose or a lily in the i-th position. Thus each of n positions should contain exactly one flower: a rose or a lily.She knows that exactly m people will visit this exhibition. The i-th visitor will visit all flowers from l_i to r_i inclusive. The girl knows that each segment has its own beauty that is equal to the product of the number of roses and the number of lilies.Sonya wants her exhibition to be liked by a lot of people. That is why she wants to put the flowers in such way that the sum of beauties of all segments would be maximum possible.
