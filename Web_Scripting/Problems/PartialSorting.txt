Consider a permutation^\dagger p of length 3n. Each time you can do one of the following operations:  Sort the first 2n elements in increasing order.  Sort the last 2n elements in increasing order. We can show that every permutation can be made sorted in increasing order using only these operations. Let's call f(p) the minimum number of these operations needed to make the permutation p sorted in increasing order.Given n, find the sum of f(p) over all (3n)! permutations p of size 3n.Since the answer could be very large, output it modulo a prime M.^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
