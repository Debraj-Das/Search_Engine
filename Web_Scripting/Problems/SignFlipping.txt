You are given n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, where n is odd. You are allowed to flip the sign of some (possibly all or none) of them. You wish to perform these flips in such a way that the following conditions hold:  At least \frac{n - 1}{2} of the adjacent differences a_{i + 1} - a_i for i = 1, 2, \dots, n - 1 are greater than or equal to 0.  At least \frac{n - 1}{2} of the adjacent differences a_{i + 1} - a_i for i = 1, 2, \dots, n - 1 are less than or equal to 0. Find any valid way to flip the signs. It can be shown that under the given constraints, there always exists at least one choice of signs to flip that satisfies the required condition. If there are several solutions, you can find any of them.
