There is a bus stop near the university The lessons are over and n students come to the stop The ith student will appear at the bus stop at time ti all tis are distinctWe shall assume that the stop is located on the coordinate axis Ox at point x0 and the bus goes along the ray Ox that is towards the positive direction of the coordinate axis and back The ith student needs to get to the point with coordinate xi xi0The bus moves by the following algorithm Initially it is at point 0 The students consistently come to the stop and get on it The bus has a seating capacity which is equal to m passengers At the moment when m students get on the bus it starts moving in the positive direction of the coordinate axis Also it starts moving when the last nth student gets on the bus The bus is moving at a speed of 1 unit of distance per 1 unit of time ie it covers distance y in time yEvery time the bus passes the point at which at least one student needs to get off it stops and these students get off the bus The students need 1k2 units of time to get off the bus where k is the number of students who leave at this point Expression k2 denotes rounded down k2 As soon as the last student leaves the bus the bus turns around and goes back to the point x0 It doesnt make any stops until it reaches the point At the given point the bus fills with students once more and everything is repeatedIf students come to the stop when theres no bus they form a line queue and get on the bus in the order in which they came Any number of students get on the bus in negligible time you should assume that it doesnt take any time Any other actions also take no time The bus has no other passengers apart from the studentsWrite a program that will determine for each student the time when he got off the bus The moment a student got off the bus is the moment the bus stopped at the students destination stop despite the fact that the group of students need some time to get off
