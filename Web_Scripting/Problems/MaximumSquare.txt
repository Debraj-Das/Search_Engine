Ujan decided to make a new wooden roof for the house. He has n rectangular planks numbered from 1 to n. The i-th plank has size a_i \times 1 (that is, the width is 1 and the height is a_i).Now, Ujan wants to make a square roof. He will first choose some of the planks and place them side by side in some order. Then he will glue together all of these planks by their vertical sides. Finally, he will cut out a square from the resulting shape in such a way that the sides of the square are horizontal and vertical.For example, if Ujan had planks with lengths 4, 3, 1, 4 and 5, he could choose planks with lengths 4, 3 and 5. Then he can cut out a 3 \times 3 square, which is the maximum possible. Note that this is not the only way he can obtain a 3 \times 3 square.  What is the maximum side length of the square Ujan can get?
