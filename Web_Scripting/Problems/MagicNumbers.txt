Consider the decimal presentation of an integer Lets call a number dmagic if digit d appears in decimal presentation of the number on even positions and nowhere elseFor example the numbers 1727374 17 1 are 7magic but 77 7 123 34 71 are not 7magic On the other hand the number 7 is 0magic 123 is 2magic 34 is 4magic and 71 is 1magicFind the number of dmagic numbers in the segment ab that are multiple of m Because the answer can be very huge you should only find its value modulo 1097 so you should find the remainder after dividing by 1097
