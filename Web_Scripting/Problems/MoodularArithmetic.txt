As behooves any intelligent schoolboy Kevin Sun is studying psycowlogy cowculus and cryptcowgraphy at the Bovinia State University BGU under Farmer Ivan During his Mathematics of Olympiads MoO class Kevin was confronted with a weird functional equation and needs your help For two fixed integers k and p where p is an odd prime number the functional equation states that  for some function  This equation should hold for any integer x in the range 0 to p1 inclusiveIt turns out that f can actually be many different functions Instead of finding a solution Kevin wants you to count the number of distinct functions f that satisfy this equation Since the answer may be very large you should print your result modulo 1097
