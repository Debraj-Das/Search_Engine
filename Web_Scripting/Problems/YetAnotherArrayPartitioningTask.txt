An array b is called to be a subarray of a if it forms a continuous subsequence of a, that is, if it is equal to a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r for some l, r.Suppose m is some known constant. For any array, having m or more elements, let's define it's beauty as the sum of m largest elements of that array. For example:   For array x = [4, 3, 1, 5, 2] and m = 3, the 3 largest elements of x are 5, 4 and 3, so the beauty of x is 5 + 4 + 3 = 12. For array x = [10, 10, 10] and m = 2, the beauty of x is 10 + 10 = 20.You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, the value of the said constant m and an integer k. Your need to split the array a into exactly k subarrays such that:  Each element from a belongs to exactly one subarray. Each subarray has at least m elements. The sum of all beauties of k subarrays is maximum possible.
