The subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.You are given an integer n. You have to find a sequence s consisting of digits \{1, 3, 7\} such that it has exactly n subsequences equal to 1337.For example, sequence 337133377 has 6 subsequences equal to 1337:   337\underline{1}3\underline{3}\underline{3}7\underline{7} (you can remove the second and fifth characters);  337\underline{1}\underline{3}3\underline{3}7\underline{7} (you can remove the third and fifth characters);  337\underline{1}\underline{3}\underline{3}37\underline{7} (you can remove the fourth and fifth characters);  337\underline{1}3\underline{3}\underline{3}\underline{7}7 (you can remove the second and sixth characters);  337\underline{1}\underline{3}3\underline{3}\underline{7}7 (you can remove the third and sixth characters);  337\underline{1}\underline{3}\underline{3}3\underline{7}7 (you can remove the fourth and sixth characters). Note that the length of the sequence s must not exceed 10^5.You have to answer t independent queries.
