One of Arkady's friends works at a huge radio telescope. A few decades ago the telescope has sent a signal s towards a faraway galaxy. Recently they've received a response t which they believe to be a response from aliens! The scientists now want to check if the signal t is similar to s.The original signal s was a sequence of zeros and ones (everyone knows that binary code is the universe-wide language). The returned signal t, however, does not look as easy as s, but the scientists don't give up! They represented t as a sequence of English letters and say that t is similar to s if you can replace all zeros in s with some string r_0 and all ones in s with some other string r_1 and obtain t. The strings r_0 and r_1 must be different and non-empty.Please help Arkady's friend and find the number of possible replacements for zeros and ones (the number of pairs of strings r_0 and r_1) that transform s to t.
