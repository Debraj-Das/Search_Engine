We will consider the numbers a and b as adjacent if they differ by exactly one, that is, |a-b|=1.We will consider cells of a square matrix n \times n as adjacent if they have a common side, that is, for cell (r, c) cells (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r-1, c) and (r+1, c) are adjacent to it.For a given number n, construct a square matrix n \times n such that:   Each integer from 1 to n^2 occurs in this matrix exactly once;  If (r_1, c_1) and (r_2, c_2) are adjacent cells, then the numbers written in them must not be adjacent.
