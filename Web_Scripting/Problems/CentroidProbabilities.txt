Consider every tree (connected undirected acyclic graph) with n vertices (n is odd, vertices numbered from 1 to n), and for each 2 \le i \le n the i-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index.For each i (1 \le i \le n) calculate the number of trees for which the i-th vertex will be the centroid. The answer can be huge, output it modulo 998\,244\,353.A vertex is called a centroid if its removal splits the tree into subtrees with at most (n-1)/2 vertices each.
