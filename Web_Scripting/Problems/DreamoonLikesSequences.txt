Dreamoon likes sequences very much. So he created a problem about the sequence that you can't find in OEIS: You are given two integers d, m, find the number of arrays a, satisfying the following constraints:  The length of a is n, n \ge 1  1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d  Define an array b of length n as follows: b_1 = a_1, \forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i, where \oplus is the bitwise exclusive-or (xor). After constructing an array b, the constraint b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n should hold. Since the number of possible arrays may be too large, you need to find the answer modulo m.
