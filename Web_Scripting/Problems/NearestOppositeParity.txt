You are given an array a consisting of n integers. In one move, you can jump from the position i to the position i - a_i (if 1 \le i - a_i) or to the position i + a_i (if i + a_i \le n).For each position i from 1 to n you want to know the minimum the number of moves required to reach any position j such that a_j has the opposite parity from a_i (i.e. if a_i is odd then a_j has to be even and vice versa).
