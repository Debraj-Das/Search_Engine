There are n chips arranged in a circle, numbered from 1 to n. Initially each chip has black or white color. Then k iterations occur. During each iteration the chips change their colors according to the following rules. For each chip i, three chips are considered: chip i itself and two its neighbours. If the number of white chips among these three is greater than the number of black chips among these three chips, then the chip i becomes white. Otherwise, the chip i becomes black. Note that for each i from 2 to (n - 1) two neighbouring chips have numbers (i - 1) and (i + 1). The neighbours for the chip i = 1 are n and 2. The neighbours of i = n are (n - 1) and 1.The following picture describes one iteration with n = 6. The chips 1, 3 and 4 are initially black, and the chips 2, 5 and 6 are white. After the iteration 2, 3 and 4 become black, and 1, 5 and 6 become white.  Your task is to determine the color of each chip after k iterations.
