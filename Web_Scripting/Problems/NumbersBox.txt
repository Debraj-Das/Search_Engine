You are given a rectangular grid with n rows and m columns. The cell located on the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left has a value a_{ij} written in it.You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):  Choose any two adjacent cells and multiply the values in them by -1. Two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. Note that you can use a cell more than once in different operations.You are interested in X, the sum of all the numbers in the grid. What is the maximum X you can achieve with these operations?
