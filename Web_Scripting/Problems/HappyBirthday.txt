You have a set of birthday cake candles. Each of such candles represents a digit between 0 and 9, inclusive.  Example of birthday cake candles. Let's denote the candle representing the digit d as d-candle.Your set contains c_0 instances of 0-candles, c_1 instances of 1-candles and so on. So, the total number of candles is c_0+c_1+\dots+c_9.These digits are needed to wish your cat a happy birthday. For each birthday, starting with the first, you want to compose the age of the cat using the digits from the set.Since you light candles for a very short time, candles don't have time to burn out. For this reason you can reuse candles an arbitrary number of times (therefore your set of candles never changes).For example, if you have one instance of each digit (i.e. c_0=c_1=\dots=c_9=1), you can compose any number from 1 to 10 using this set, but you cannot compose 11.You have to determine the first birthday, on which you cannot compose the age of the cat using the candles from your set. In other words, find the minimum number y such that all numbers from 1 to y-1 can be composed by digits from your set, but y cannot be composed.
