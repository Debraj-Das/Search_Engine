You are given an integer n and an array a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n.In one operation, you can choose an index i (1 \le i \lt n) for which a_i \neq a_{i+1} and delete both a_i and a_{i+1} from the array. After deleting a_i and a_{i+1}, the remaining parts of the array are concatenated.For example, if a=[1,4,3,3,6,2], then after performing an operation with i=2, the resulting array will be [1,3,6,2].What is the maximum possible length of an array of equal elements obtainable from a by performing several (perhaps none) of the aforementioned operations?
