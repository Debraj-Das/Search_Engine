Note that this is the first problem of the two similar problems. You can hack this problem only if you solve both problems.You are given a tree with n nodes. In the beginning, 0 is written on all edges. In one operation, you can choose any 2 distinct leaves u, v and any real number x and add x to values written on all edges on the simple path between u and v.For example, on the picture below you can see the result of applying two operations to the graph: adding 2 on the path from 7 to 6, and then adding -0.5 on the path from 4 to 5.   Is it true that for any configuration of real numbers written on edges, we can achieve it with a finite number of operations?Leaf is a node of a tree of degree 1. Simple path is a path that doesn't contain any node twice.
