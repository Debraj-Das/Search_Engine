Let's call left cyclic shift of some string t_1 t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1} t_n as string t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1} t_n t_1.Analogically, let's call right cyclic shift of string t as string t_n t_1 t_2 t_3 \dots t_{n - 1}.Let's say string t is good if its left cyclic shift is equal to its right cyclic shift.You are given string s which consists of digits 0–9.What is the minimum number of characters you need to erase from s to make it good?
