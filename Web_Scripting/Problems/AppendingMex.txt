Initially Ildar has an empty array. He performs n steps. On each step he takes a subset of integers already added to the array and appends the mex of this subset to the array. The mex of an multiset of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not presented in the multiset. For example, the mex of the multiset [0, 2, 3] is 1, while the mex of the multiset [1, 2, 1] is 0.More formally, on the step m, when Ildar already has an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{m-1}, he chooses some subset of indices 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k < m (possibly, empty), where 0 \leq k < m, and appends the mex(a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots a_{i_k}) to the end of the array.After performing all the steps Ildar thinks that he might have made a mistake somewhere. He asks you to determine for a given array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n the minimum step t such that he has definitely made a mistake on at least one of the steps 1, 2, \ldots, t, or determine that he could have obtained this array without mistakes.
