This problem is the most boring one youve ever seen Given a sequence of integers a1a2an and a nonnegative integer h our goal is to partition the sequence into two subsequences not necessarily consist of continuous elements Each element of the original sequence should be contained in exactly one of the result subsequences Note that one of the result subsequences can be emptyLets define function faiaj on pairs of distinct elements that is ij in the original sequence If ai and aj are in the same subsequence in the current partition then faiajaiaj otherwise faiajaiajh Consider all possible values of the function f for some partition Well call the goodness of this partiotion the difference between the maximum value of function f and the minimum value of function fYour task is to find a partition of the given sequence a that have the minimal possible goodness among all possible partitions
