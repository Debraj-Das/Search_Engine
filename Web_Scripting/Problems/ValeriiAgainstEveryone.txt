You're given an array b of length n. Let's define another array a, also of length n, for which a_i = 2^{b_i} (1 \leq i \leq n). Valerii says that every two non-intersecting subarrays of a have different sums of elements. You want to determine if he is wrong. More formally, you need to determine if there exist four integers l_1,r_1,l_2,r_2 that satisfy the following conditions:   1 \leq l_1 \leq r_1 \lt l_2 \leq r_2 \leq n;  a_{l_1}+a_{l_1+1}+\ldots+a_{r_1-1}+a_{r_1} = a_{l_2}+a_{l_2+1}+\ldots+a_{r_2-1}+a_{r_2}. If such four integers exist, you will prove Valerii wrong. Do they exist?An array c is a subarray of an array d if c can be obtained from d by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
