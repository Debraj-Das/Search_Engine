Hag is a very talented person. He has always had an artist inside him but his father forced him to study mechanical engineering.Yesterday he spent all of his time cutting a giant piece of wood trying to make it look like a goose. Anyway, his dad found out that he was doing arts rather than studying mechanics and other boring subjects. He confronted Hag with the fact that he is a spoiled son that does not care about his future, and if he continues to do arts he will cut his 25 Lira monthly allowance.Hag is trying to prove to his dad that the wooden piece is a project for mechanics subject. He also told his dad that the wooden piece is a strictly convex polygon with n vertices.Hag brought two pins and pinned the polygon with them in the 1-st and 2-nd vertices to the wall. His dad has q queries to Hag of two types.   1 f t: pull a pin from the vertex f, wait for the wooden polygon to rotate under the gravity force (if it will rotate) and stabilize. And then put the pin in vertex t.  2 v: answer what are the coordinates of the vertex v. Please help Hag to answer his father's queries.You can assume that the wood that forms the polygon has uniform density and the polygon has a positive thickness, same in all points. After every query of the 1-st type Hag's dad tries to move the polygon a bit and watches it stabilize again.
