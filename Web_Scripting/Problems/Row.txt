You're given a row with n chairs. We call a seating of people "maximal" if the two following conditions hold:  There are no neighbors adjacent to anyone seated.  It's impossible to seat one more person without violating the first rule. The seating is given as a string consisting of zeros and ones (0 means that the corresponding seat is empty, 1 — occupied). The goal is to determine whether this seating is "maximal".Note that the first and last seats are not adjacent (if n \ne 2).
