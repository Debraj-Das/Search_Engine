You are given a connected weighted undirected graph without any loops and multiple edges. Let us remind you that a graph's spanning tree is defined as an acyclic connected subgraph of the given graph that includes all of the graph's vertexes. The weight of a tree is defined as the sum of weights of the edges that the given tree contains. The minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph is defined as the graph's spanning tree having the minimum possible weight. For any connected graph obviously exists the minimum spanning tree, but in the general case, a graph's minimum spanning tree is not unique.Your task is to determine the following for each edge of the given graph: whether it is either included in any MST, or included at least in one MST, or not included in any MST.
