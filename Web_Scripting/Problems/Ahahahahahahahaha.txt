Alexandra has an even-length array a, consisting of 0s and 1s. The elements of the array are enumerated from 1 to n. She wants to remove at most \frac{n}{2} elements (where n — length of array) in the way that alternating sum of the array will be equal 0 (i.e. a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \dotsc = 0). In other words, Alexandra wants sum of all elements at the odd positions and sum of all elements at the even positions to become equal. The elements that you remove don't have to be consecutive.For example, if she has a = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] and she removes 2nd and 4th elements, a will become equal [1, 1, 0, 0] and its alternating sum is 1 - 1 + 0 - 0 = 0.Help her!
