You're given an array a_1, \ldots, a_n of n non-negative integers.Let's call it sharpened if and only if there exists an integer 1 \le k \le n such that a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_k and a_k > a_{k+1} > \ldots > a_n. In particular, any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing array is sharpened. For example:  The arrays [4], [0, 1], [12, 10, 8] and [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] are sharpened;  The arrays [2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 5], [0, 1, 1, 0] and [2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 8] are not sharpened. You can do the following operation as many times as you want: choose any strictly positive element of the array, and decrease it by one. Formally, you can choose any i (1 \le i \le n) such that a_i>0 and assign a_i := a_i - 1.Tell if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using some number (possibly zero) of these operations.
