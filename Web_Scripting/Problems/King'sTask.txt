The brave Knight came to the King and asked permission to marry the princess. The King knew that the Knight was brave, but he also wanted to know if he was smart enough. So he asked him to solve the following task.There is a permutation p_i of numbers from 1 to 2n. You can make two types of operations.   Swap p_1 and p_2, p_3 and p_4, ..., p_{2n-1} and p_{2n}.  Swap p_1 and p_{n+1}, p_2 and p_{n+2}, ..., p_{n} and p_{2n}. The task is to find the minimal number of operations required to sort the given permutation.The Knight was not that smart actually, but quite charming, so the princess asks you to help him to solve the King's task.
