You are given an integer value x and a string s consisting of digits from 1 to 9 inclusive.A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.Let f(l, r) be the sum of digits of a substring s[l..r].Let's call substring s[l_1..r_1] x-prime if   f(l_1, r_1) = x;  there are no values l_2, r_2 such that   l_1 \le l_2 \le r_2 \le r_1;  f(l_2, r_2) \neq x;  x is divisible by f(l_2, r_2).  You are allowed to erase some characters from the string. If you erase a character, the two resulting parts of the string are concatenated without changing their order.What is the minimum number of characters you should erase from the string so that there are no x-prime substrings in it? If there are no x-prime substrings in the given string s, then print 0.
