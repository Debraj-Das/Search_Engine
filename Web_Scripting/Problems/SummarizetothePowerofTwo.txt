A sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n is called good if, for each element a_i, there exists an element a_j (i \ne j) such that a_i+a_j is a power of two (that is, 2^d for some non-negative integer d).For example, the following sequences are good:  [5, 3, 11] (for example, for a_1=5 we can choose a_2=3. Note that their sum is a power of two. Similarly, such an element can be found for a_2 and a_3),  [1, 1, 1, 1023],  [7, 39, 89, 25, 89],  []. Note that, by definition, an empty sequence (with a length of 0) is good.For example, the following sequences are not good:  [16] (for a_1=16, it is impossible to find another element a_j such that their sum is a power of two),  [4, 16] (for a_1=4, it is impossible to find another element a_j such that their sum is a power of two),  [1, 3, 2, 8, 8, 8] (for a_3=2, it is impossible to find another element a_j such that their sum is a power of two). You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. What is the minimum number of elements you need to remove to make it good? You can delete an arbitrary set of elements.
