You are given a simple undirected graph with n nodes and m edges. Note that the graph is not necessarily connected. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n.We define a graph to be a Fish Graph if it contains a simple cycle with a special node u belonging to the cycle. Apart from the edges in the cycle, the graph should have exactly 2 extra edges. Both edges should connect to node u, but they should not be connected to any other node of the cycle. Determine if the graph contains a subgraph that is a Fish Graph, and if so, find any such subgraph.In this problem, we define a subgraph as a graph obtained by taking any subset of the edges of the original graph.  Visualization of example 1. The red edges form one possible subgraph that is a Fish Graph.
