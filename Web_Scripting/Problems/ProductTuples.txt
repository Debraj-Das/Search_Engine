While roaming the mystic areas of Stonefalls, in order to drop legendary loot, an adventurer was given a quest as follows. He was given an array A = {a_1,a_2,...,a_N } of length N, and a number K.Define array B as B(q, A) =  { q-a_1, q-a_2, ..., q-a_N }. Define function F as F(B,K) being sum of products of all K-tuples of elements in array B. For example, if the array B is [2,3,4,5], and with K=3, sum of products of all 3-tuples is F(B, 3) = 2*3*4+2*3*5+3*4*5+2*4*5He was then given a number Q, number of queries of two types:   Type 1: Given q, i, and d calculate F(B(q, A), K) where we make change to initial array as A[i] = d.  Type 2: Given q, L, R, and d calculate F(B(q, A), K) where we make change to initial array as A[i] = A[i] + d for all i in range [L, R] inclusive. All changes are temporarily made to initial array, and don't propagate to following queries. Help the adventurer calculate the answer to a quest, and finally get that loot!
