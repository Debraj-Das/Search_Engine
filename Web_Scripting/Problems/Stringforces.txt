You are given a string s of length n. Each character is either one of the first k lowercase Latin letters or a question mark.You are asked to replace every question mark with one of the first k lowercase Latin letters in such a way that the following value is maximized.Let f_i be the maximum length substring of string s, which consists entirely of the i-th Latin letter. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. If the i-th letter doesn't appear in a string, then f_i is equal to 0.The value of a string s is the minimum value among f_i for all i from 1 to k.What is the maximum value the string can have?
