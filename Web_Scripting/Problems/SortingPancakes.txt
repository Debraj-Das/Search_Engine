Nastya baked m pancakes and spread them on n dishes. The dishes are in a row and numbered from left to right. She put a_i pancakes on the dish with the index i.Seeing the dishes, Vlad decided to bring order to the stacks and move some pancakes. In one move, he can shift one pancake from any dish to the closest one, that is, select the dish i (a_i > 0) and do one of the following: if i > 1, put the pancake on a dish with the previous index, after this move a_i = a_i - 1 and a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} + 1; if i < n, put the pancake on a dish with the following index, after this move a_i = a_i - 1 and a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} + 1.Vlad wants to make the array anon-increasing, after moving as few pancakes as possible. Help him find the minimum number of moves needed for this.The array a=[a_1, a_2,\dots,a_n] is called non-increasing if a_i \ge a_{i+1} for all i from 1 to n-1.
