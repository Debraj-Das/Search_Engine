Polycarp has to solve exactly n problems to improve his programming skill before an important programming competition. But this competition will be held very soon, most precisely, it will start in k days. It means that Polycarp has exactly k days for training!Polycarp doesn't want to procrastinate, so he wants to solve at least one problem during each of k days. He also doesn't want to overwork, so if he solves x problems during some day, he should solve no more than 2x problems during the next day. And, at last, he wants to improve his skill, so if he solves x problems during some day, he should solve at least x+1 problem during the next day.More formally: let [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k] be the array of numbers of problems solved by Polycarp. The i-th element of this array is the number of problems Polycarp solves during the i-th day of his training. Then the following conditions must be satisfied:   sum of all a_i for i from 1 to k should be n;  a_i should be greater than zero for each i from 1 to k;  the condition a_i < a_{i + 1} \le 2 a_i should be satisfied for each i from 1 to k-1. Your problem is to find any array a of length k satisfying the conditions above or say that it is impossible to do it.
