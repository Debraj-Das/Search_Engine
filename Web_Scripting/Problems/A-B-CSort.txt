You are given three arrays a, b and c. Initially, array a consists of n elements, arrays b and c are empty.You are performing the following algorithm that consists of two steps:   Step 1: while a is not empty, you take the last element from a and move it in the middle of array b. If b currently has odd length, you can choose: place the element from a to the left or to the right of the middle element of b. As a result, a becomes empty and b consists of n elements.  Step 2: while b is not empty, you take the middle element from b and move it to the end of array c. If b currently has even length, you can choose which of two middle elements to take. As a result, b becomes empty and c now consists of n elements.  Refer to the Note section for examples.Can you make array c sorted in non-decreasing order?
