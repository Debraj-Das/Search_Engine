You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers. You can perform operations on it.In one operation you can replace any element of the array a_i with \lfloor \frac{a_i}{2} \rfloor, that is, by an integer part of dividing a_i by 2 (rounding down).See if you can apply the operation some number of times (possible 0) to make the array a become a permutation of numbers from 1 to n —that is, so that it contains all numbers from 1 to n, each exactly once.For example, if a = [1, 8, 25, 2], n = 4, then the answer is yes. You could do the following:  Replace 8 with \lfloor \frac{8}{2} \rfloor = 4, then a = [1, 4, 25, 2].  Replace 25 with \lfloor \frac{25}{2} \rfloor = 12, then a = [1, 4, 12, 2].  Replace 12 with \lfloor \frac{12}{2} \rfloor = 6, then a = [1, 4, 6, 2].  Replace 6 with \lfloor \frac{6}{2} \rfloor = 3, then a = [1, 4, 3, 2].
