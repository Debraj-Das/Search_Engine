In the official contest this problem has a different statement for which jurys solution was working incorrectly and for this reason it was excluded from the contest This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contestVova and Lesha are friends They often meet at Vovas place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri Swordsink Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight A warrior is good at melee combat so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possibleThere are n n is always even possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x1x2xn two characters cannot end up at the same positionVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions Vova moves first During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha They continue to make moves until there are only two possible positions remaining thus the total number of moves will be n2 After that Vovas character takes the position with the lesser coordinate and Leshas character takes the position with the bigger coordinate and the guys start fightingVova and Lesha are already tired by the game of choosing positions as they need to play it before every fight so they asked you the developer of the The Ancient Papyri Swordsink to write a module that would automatically determine the distance at which the warrior and the archer will start fighting if both Vova and Lesha play optimally
