Tonight is brain dinner night and all zombies will gather together to scarf down some delicious brains The artful Heidi plans to crash the party incognito disguised as one of them Her objective is to get away with at least one brain so she can analyze the zombies mindset back home and gain a strategic advantageThey will be N guests tonight N1 real zombies and a fake one our Heidi The livingdead love hierarchies as much as they love brains each one has a unique rank in the range 1 to N1 and Heidi who still appears slightly different from the others is attributed the highest rank N Tonight there will be a chest with brains on display and every attendee sees how many there are These will then be split among the attendees according to the following procedureThe zombie of the highest rank makes a suggestion on who gets how many brains every brain is an indivisible entity A vote follows If at least half of the attendees accept the offer the brains are shared in the suggested way and the feast begins But if majority is not reached then the highestranked zombie is killed and the next zombie in hierarchy has to make a suggestion If he is killed too then the third highestranked makes one etc Its enough to have exactly half of the votes  in case of a tie the vote of the highestranked alive zombie counts twice and he will of course vote in favor of his own suggestion in order to stay aliveYou should know that zombies are very greedy and sly and they know this too  basically all zombie brains are alike Consequently a zombie will never accept an offer which is suboptimal for him That is if an offer is not strictly better than a potential later offer he will vote against it And make no mistake while zombies may normally seem rather dull tonight their intellects are perfect Each zombies priorities for tonight are in descending order   survive the event they experienced death already once and know it is no fun  get as many brains as possible Heidi goes first and must make an offer which at least half of the attendees will accept and which allocates at least one brain for Heidi herselfWhat is the smallest number of brains that have to be in the chest for this to be possible
