While creating high loaded systems one should pay a special attention to caching. This problem will be about one of the most popular caching algorithms called LRU (Least Recently Used).Suppose the cache may store no more than k objects. At the beginning of the workflow the cache is empty. When some object is queried we check if it is present in the cache and move it here if it's not. If there are more than k objects in the cache after this, the least recently used one should be removed. In other words, we remove the object that has the smallest time of the last query.Consider there are n videos being stored on the server, all of the same size. Cache can store no more than k videos and caching algorithm described above is applied. We know that any time a user enters the server he pick the video i with probability pi. The choice of the video is independent to any events before.The goal of this problem is to count for each of the videos the probability it will be present in the cache after 10100 queries.
