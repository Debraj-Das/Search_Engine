Dasha logged into the system and began to solve problems One of them is as followsGiven two sequences a and b of length n each you need to write a sequence c of length n the ith element of which is calculated as follows cibiaiAbout sequences a and b we know that their elements are in the range from l to r More formally elements satisfy the following conditions lair and lbir About sequence c we know that all its elements are distinct  Dasha wrote a solution to that problem quickly but checking her work on the standard test was not so easy Due to an error in the test system only the sequence a and the compressed sequence of the sequence c were known from that testLets give the definition to a compressed sequence A compressed sequence of sequence c of length n is a sequence p of length n so that pi equals to the number of integers which are less than or equal to ci in the sequence c For example for the sequence c25020030010050 the compressed sequence will be p43521 Pay attention that in c all integers are distinct Consequently the compressed sequence contains all integers from 1 to n inclusivelyHelp Dasha to find any sequence b for which the calculated compressed sequence of sequence c is correct
