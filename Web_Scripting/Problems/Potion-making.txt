You have an initially empty cauldron, and you want to brew a potion in it. The potion consists of two ingredients: magic essence and water. The potion you want to brew should contain exactly k\ \% magic essence and (100 - k)\ \% water.In one step, you can pour either one liter of magic essence or one liter of water into the cauldron. What is the minimum number of steps to brew a potion? You don't care about the total volume of the potion, only about the ratio between magic essence and water in it.A small reminder: if you pour e liters of essence and w liters of water (e + w > 0) into the cauldron, then it contains \frac{e}{e + w} \cdot 100\ \% (without rounding) magic essence and \frac{w}{e + w} \cdot 100\ \% water.
