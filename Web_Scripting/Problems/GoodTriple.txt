Toad Rash has a binary string s. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones.Let n be the length of s.Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers l, r that 1 \leq l \leq r \leq n and there is at least one pair of integers x, k such that 1 \leq x, k \leq n, l \leq x < x + 2k \leq r, and s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}.Find this number of pairs for Rash.
