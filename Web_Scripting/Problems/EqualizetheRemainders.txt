You are given an array consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, and a positive integer m. It is guaranteed that m is a divisor of n.In a single move, you can choose any position i between 1 and n and increase a_i by 1.Let's calculate c_r (0 \le r \le m-1) — the number of elements having remainder r when divided by m. In other words, for each remainder, let's find the number of corresponding elements in a with that remainder.Your task is to change the array in such a way that c_0 = c_1 = \dots = c_{m-1} = \frac{n}{m}.Find the minimum number of moves to satisfy the above requirement.
