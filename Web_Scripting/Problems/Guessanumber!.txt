A TV show called "Guess a number!" is gathering popularity. The whole Berland, the old and the young, are watching the show.The rules are simple. The host thinks of an integer y and the participants guess it by asking questions to the host. There are four types of acceptable questions:  Is it true that y is strictly larger than number x?  Is it true that y is strictly smaller than number x?  Is it true that y is larger than or equal to number x?  Is it true that y is smaller than or equal to number x? On each question the host answers truthfully, "yes" or "no".Given the sequence of questions and answers, find any integer value of y that meets the criteria of all answers. If there isn't such value, print "Impossible".
