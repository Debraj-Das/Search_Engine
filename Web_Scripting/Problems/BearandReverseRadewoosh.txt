Limak and Radewoosh are going to compete against each other in the upcoming algorithmic contest They are equally skilled but they wont solve problems in the same orderThere will be n problems The ith problem has initial score pi and it takes exactly ti minutes to solve it Problems are sorted by difficulty its guaranteed that pipi1 and titi1A constant c is given too representing the speed of loosing points Then submitting the ith problem at time x x minutes after the start of the contest gives max0 picx pointsLimak is going to solve problems in order 12n sorted increasingly by pi Radewoosh is going to solve them in order nn11 sorted decreasingly by pi Your task is to predict the outcome print the name of the winner person who gets more points at the end or a word Tie in case of a tieYou may assume that the duration of the competition is greater or equal than the sum of all ti That means both Limak and Radewoosh will accept all n problems
