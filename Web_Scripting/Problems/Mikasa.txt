You are given two integers n and m. Find the \operatorname{MEX} of the sequence n \oplus 0, n \oplus 1, \ldots, n \oplus m. Here, \oplus is the bitwise XOR operator.\operatorname{MEX} of the sequence of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't appear in this sequence. For example, \operatorname{MEX}(0, 1, 2, 4) = 3, and \operatorname{MEX}(1, 2021) = 0.
