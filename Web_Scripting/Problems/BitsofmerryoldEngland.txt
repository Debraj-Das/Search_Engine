Another feature of Shakespeare language is that the variables are named after characters of plays by Shakespeare, and all operations on them (value assignment, output etc.) look like a dialog with other characters. New values of variables are defined in a rather lengthy way, so a programmer should try to minimize their usage.You have to print the given sequence of n integers. To do this, you have m variables and two types of operations on them:  variable=integer  print(variable) Any of the m variables can be used as variable. Variables are denoted by lowercase letters between "a" and "z", inclusive. Any integer number can be used as integer.Let's say that the penalty for using first type of operations equals to the number of set bits in the number integer. There is no penalty on using second type of operations. Find and output the program which minimizes the penalty for printing the given sequence of numbers.
