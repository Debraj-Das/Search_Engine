Arkady wants to water his only flower. Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for n flowers and so it looks like a pipe with n holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.Arkady can block some of the holes, and then pour A liters of water into the pipe. After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n. In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is S, and the i-th hole is not blocked, \frac{s_i \cdot A}{S} liters of water will flow out of it.What is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least B liters of water flow out of the first hole?
