You are given three strings s, t and p consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations on these strings.During each operation you choose any character from p, erase it from p and insert it into string s (you may insert this character anywhere you want: in the beginning of s, in the end or between any two consecutive characters). For example, if p is aba, and s is de, then the following outcomes are possible (the character we erase from p and insert into s is highlighted):  aba \rightarrow ba, de \rightarrow ade;  aba \rightarrow ba, de \rightarrow dae;  aba \rightarrow ba, de \rightarrow dea;  aba \rightarrow aa, de \rightarrow bde;  aba \rightarrow aa, de \rightarrow dbe;  aba \rightarrow aa, de \rightarrow deb;  aba \rightarrow ab, de \rightarrow ade;  aba \rightarrow ab, de \rightarrow dae;  aba \rightarrow ab, de \rightarrow dea; Your goal is to perform several (maybe zero) operations so that s becomes equal to t. Please determine whether it is possible.Note that you have to answer q independent queries.
