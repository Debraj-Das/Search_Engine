Vitya has learned that the answer for The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is not the integer 54 42, but an increasing integer sequence a_1, \ldots, a_n. In order to not reveal the secret earlier than needed, Vitya encrypted the answer and obtained the sequence b_1, \ldots, b_n using the following rules:  b_1 = a_1; b_i = a_i \oplus a_{i - 1} for all i from 2 to n, where x \oplus y is the bitwise XOR of x and y. It is easy to see that the original sequence can be obtained using the rule a_i = b_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus b_i.However, some time later Vitya discovered that the integers b_i in the cypher got shuffled, and it can happen that when decrypted using the rule mentioned above, it can produce a sequence that is not increasing. In order to save his reputation in the scientific community, Vasya decided to find some permutation of integers b_i so that the sequence a_i = b_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus b_i is strictly increasing. Help him find such a permutation or determine that it is impossible.
