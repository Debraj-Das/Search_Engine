Vasya plays Robot Bicorn Attack.The game consists of three rounds. For each one a non-negative integer amount of points is given. The result of the game is the sum of obtained points. Vasya has already played three rounds and wrote obtained points one by one (without leading zeros) into the string s. Vasya decided to brag about his achievement to the friends. However, he has forgotten how many points he got for each round. The only thing he remembers is the string s.Help Vasya to find out what is the maximum amount of points he could get. Take into account that Vasya played Robot Bicorn Attack for the first time, so he could not get more than 1000000 (106) points for one round.
