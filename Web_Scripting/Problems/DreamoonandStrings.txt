Dreamoon has a string s and a pattern string p. He first removes exactly x characters from s obtaining string s' as a result. Then he calculates  that is defined as the maximal number of non-overlapping substrings equal to p that can be found in s'. He wants to make this number as big as possible.More formally, let's define  as maximum value of  over all s' that can be obtained by removing exactly x characters from s. Dreamoon wants to know  for all x from 0 to |s| where |s| denotes the length of string s.
