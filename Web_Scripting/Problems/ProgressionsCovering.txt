You are given two arrays an array a consisting of n zeros and an array b consisting of n integersYou can apply the following operation to the array a an arbitrary number of times choose some subsegment of a of length k and add the arithmetic progression 1 2 ldots k to this subsegment  ie add 1 to the first element of the subsegment 2 to the second element and so on The chosen subsegment should be inside the borders of the array a ie if the left border of the chosen subsegment is l then the condition 1 le l le l  k  1 le n should be satisfied Note that the progression added is always 1 2 ldots k but not the k k  1 ldots 1 or anything else ie the leftmost element of the subsegment always increases by 1 the second element always increases by 2 and so onYour task is to find the minimum possible number of operations required to satisfy the condition ai ge bi for each i from 1 to n Note that the condition ai ge bi should be satisfied for all elements at once
