One player came to a casino and found a slot machine where everything depends only on how he plays. The rules follow.A positive integer a is initially on the screen. The player can put a coin into the machine and then add 1 to or subtract 1 from any two adjacent digits. All digits must remain from 0 to 9 after this operation, and the leading digit must not equal zero. In other words, it is forbidden to add 1 to 9, to subtract 1 from 0 and to subtract 1 from the leading 1. Once the number on the screen becomes equal to b, the player wins the jackpot. a and b have the same number of digits.Help the player to determine the minimal number of coins he needs to spend in order to win the jackpot and tell how to play.
