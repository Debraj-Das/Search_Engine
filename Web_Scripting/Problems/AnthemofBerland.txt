King wants to mention it in the anthem as many times as possible.He has already composed major part of the anthem and now just needs to fill in some letters. King asked you to help him with this work.The anthem is the string s of no more than 105 small Latin letters and question marks. The most glorious victory is the string t of no more than 105 small Latin letters.
