PolandBall lives in a forest with his family There are some trees in the forest Trees are undirected acyclic graphs with k vertices and k1 edges where k is some integer Note that one vertex is a valid treeThere is exactly one relative living in each vertex of each tree they have unique ids from 1 to n For each Ball i we know the id of its most distant relative living on the same tree If there are several such vertices we only know the value of the one with smallest id among thoseHow many trees are there in the forest
