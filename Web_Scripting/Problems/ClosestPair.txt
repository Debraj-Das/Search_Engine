There are n weighted points on the OX-axis. The coordinate and the weight of the i-th point is x_i and w_i, respectively. All points have distinct coordinates and positive weights. Also, x_i < x_{i + 1} holds for any 1 \leq i < n. The weighted distance between i-th point and j-th point is defined as |x_i - x_j| \cdot (w_i + w_j), where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.You should answer q queries, where the i-th query asks the following: Find the minimum weighted distance among all pairs of distinct points among the points in subarray [l_i,r_i].
