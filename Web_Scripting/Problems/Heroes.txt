The year of 2012 is comingAccording to an ancient choradrican legend in this very year in 2012 Diablo and his brothers Mephisto and Baal will escape from hell and innumerable hordes of demons will enslave the human world But seven brave heroes have already gathered on the top of a mountain Arreat to protect us mere mortals from the effect of this terrible evilThe seven great heroes are amazon Anka barbarian Chapay sorceress Cleo druid Troll necromancer Dracul paladin Snowy and a professional hit girl Hexadecimal Heroes already know how much experience will be given for each of the three megabosses a for Mephisto b for Diablo and c for BaalHeres the problem heroes are as much as seven and megabosses are only three Then our heroes decided to split into three teams where each team will go to destroy their own megaboss Each team member will receive a  of experience rounded down where x will be the amount of experience for the killed megaboss and y  the number of people in the teamHeroes do not want to hurt each others feelings so they want to split into teams so that the difference between the hero who received the maximum number of experience and the hero who received the minimum number of experience were minimal Since there can be several divisions into teams then you need to find the one in which the total amount of liking in teams were maximumIt is known that some heroes like others But if hero p likes hero q this does not mean that the hero q likes hero p No hero likes himselfThe total amount of liking in teams is the amount of ordered pairs pq such that heroes p and q are in the same group and hero p likes hero q but it is not important if hero q likes hero p In case of heroes p and q likes each other and they are in the same group this pair should be counted twice as pq and qpA team can consist even of a single hero but it is important that every megaboss was destroyed All heroes must be involved in the campaign against evil None of the heroes can be in more than one teamIt is guaranteed that every hero is able to destroy any megaboss alone
