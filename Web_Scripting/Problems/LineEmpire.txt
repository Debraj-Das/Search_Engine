You are an ambitious king who wants to be the Emperor of The Reals. But to do that, you must first become Emperor of The Integers.Consider a number axis. The capital of your empire is initially at 0. There are n unconquered kingdoms at positions 0<x_1<x_2<\ldots<x_n. You want to conquer all other kingdoms.There are two actions available to you:   You can change the location of your capital (let its current position be c_1) to any other conquered kingdom (let its position be c_2) at a cost of a\cdot |c_1-c_2|.  From the current capital (let its current position be c_1) you can conquer an unconquered kingdom (let its position be c_2) at a cost of b\cdot |c_1-c_2|. You cannot conquer a kingdom if there is an unconquered kingdom between the target and your capital. Note that you cannot place the capital at a point without a kingdom. In other words, at any point, your capital can only be at 0 or one of x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n. Also note that conquering a kingdom does not change the position of your capital.Find the minimum total cost to conquer all kingdoms. Your capital can be anywhere at the end.
