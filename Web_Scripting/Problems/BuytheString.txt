You are given four integers n, c_0, c_1 and h and a binary string s of length n.A binary string is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1.You can change any character of the string s (the string should be still binary after the change). You should pay h coins for each change.After some changes (possibly zero) you want to buy the string. To buy the string you should buy all its characters. To buy the character 0 you should pay c_0 coins, to buy the character 1 you should pay c_1 coins.Find the minimum number of coins needed to buy the string.
