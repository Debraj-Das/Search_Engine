You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and the integer mOne should choose some symbols from the given string so that any contiguous subsegment of length m has at least one selected symbol Note that here we choose positions of symbols not the symbols themselvesThen one uses the chosen symbols to form a new string All symbols from the chosen position should be used but we are allowed to rearrange them in any orderFormally we choose a subsequence of indices 1i1i2its The selected sequence must meet the following condition for every j such that 1jsm1 there must be at least one selected index that belongs to the segment jjm1 ie there should exist a k from 1 to t such that jikjm1Then we take any permutation p of the selected indices and form a new string sip1sip2 siptFind the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained using this procedure
