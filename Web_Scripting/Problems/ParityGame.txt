You are fishing with polar bears Alice and Bob. While waiting for the fish to bite, the polar bears get bored. They come up with a game. First Alice and Bob each writes a 01-string (strings that only contain character "0" and "1") a and b. Then you try to turn a into b using two types of operations:  Write parity(a) to the end of a. For example, .  Remove the first character of a. For example, . You cannot perform this operation if a is empty. You can use as many operations as you want. The problem is, is it possible to turn a into b?The parity of a 01-string is 1 if there is an odd number of "1"s in the string, and 0 otherwise.
