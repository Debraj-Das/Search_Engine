Artem is building a new robot. He has a matrix a consisting of n rows and m columns. The cell located on the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left has a value a_{i,j} written in it. If two adjacent cells contain the same value, the robot will break. A matrix is called good if no two adjacent cells contain the same value, where two cells are called adjacent if they share a side. Artem wants to increment the values in some cells by one to make a good.More formally, find a good matrix b that satisfies the following condition —   For all valid (i,j), either b_{i,j} = a_{i,j} or b_{i,j} = a_{i,j}+1. For the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that such a matrix b always exists. If there are several such tables, you can output any of them. Please note that you do not have to minimize the number of increments.
