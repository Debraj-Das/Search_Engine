Let f(x,y) be the number of carries of x+y in binary (i. e. f(x,y)=g(x)+g(y)-g(x+y), where g(x) is the number of ones in the binary representation of x).Given two integers n and k, find the number of ordered pairs (a,b) such that 0 \leq a,b < 2^n, and f(a,b) equals k. Note that for a\ne b, (a,b) and (b,a) are considered as two different pairs. As this number may be large, output it modulo 10^9+7.
