Suppose you have an integer array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n.Let \operatorname{lsl}(i) be the number of indices j (1 \le j < i) such that a_j < a_i.Analogically, let \operatorname{grr}(i) be the number of indices j (i < j \le n) such that a_j > a_i.Let's name position i good in the array a if \operatorname{lsl}(i) < \operatorname{grr}(i).Finally, let's define a function f on array a f(a) as the sum of all a_i such that i is good in a.Given two integers n and k, find the sum of f(a) over all arrays a of size n such that 1 \leq a_i \leq k for all 1 \leq i \leq n modulo 998\,244\,353.
