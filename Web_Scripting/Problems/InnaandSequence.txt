Dimas spent much time thinking what present to give to Inna and gave her an empty sequence w Now they want to fill sequence w with numbers zero and one For that they decided to play an amusing game Before the game begins Dima chooses m integers a1a2am 1a1a2am Then Inna and Dima start playing that is adding numbers to sequence w Each new number they choose is added to the end of the sequence At some moments of time Dima feels that the game is going to end too soon and he wants to play with Inna as long as possible so he hits a table hard with his fist At that the a1th a2th a3th  akth numbers from the beginning simultaneously fall out of the sequence the sequence gets k numbers less Here k is such maximum number that value ak doesnt exceed the current length of the sequence If number a1 is larger than the current length of w then nothing falls out of the sequenceYou are given the chronological sequence of events in the game Each event is either adding a number to the end of sequence w or Dimas hit on the table Calculate the sequence w after all these events happen
