Recently, cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular. Ann decided that it was about time she started mining the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Ann's computer is not very powerful, so Ann mines exactly 1 Dogecoin per day. On the Internet, there are forecasts of the cost of 1 dogecoin for the next n days. Every day, Ann can sell any amount of dogecoin that she currently has. Note that if Ann mined Dogecoin on the i-th day, then she can sell it on the same day.Ann has not yet decided when to start mining. She has prepared q possible plans and for each of them wants to know the maximum profit that she can get. Each of the plans is described by two numbers l and r — the first and last days of mining. Note that Ann should not have any Dogecoin left after the r-th day.
