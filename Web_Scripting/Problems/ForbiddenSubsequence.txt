You are given strings S and T, consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that T is a permutation of the string abc. Find string S', the lexicographically smallest permutation of S such that T is not a subsequence of S'.String a is a permutation of string b if the number of occurrences of each distinct character is the same in both strings.A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: a is a prefix of b, but a \ne b; in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
