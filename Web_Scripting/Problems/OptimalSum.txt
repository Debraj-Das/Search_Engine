And here goes another problem on arrays You are given positive integer len and array a which consists of n integers a1 a2  an Lets introduce two characteristics for the given array  Lets consider an arbitrary interval of the array with length len starting in position i Value  is the modular sum on the chosen interval In other words the modular sum is the sum of integers on the chosen interval with length len taken in its absolute value Value  is the optimal sum of the array In other words the optimal sum of an array is the maximum of all modular sums on various intervals of array with length len Your task is to calculate the optimal sum of the given array a However before you do the calculations you are allowed to produce no more than k consecutive operations of the following form with this array one operation means taking an arbitrary number from array ai and multiply it by 1 In other words no more than k times you are allowed to take an arbitrary number ai from the array and replace it with ai Each number of the array is allowed to choose an arbitrary number of timesYour task is to calculate the maximum possible optimal sum of the array after at most k operations described above are completed
