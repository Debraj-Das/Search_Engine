ZS the Coder is playing a game There is a number displayed on the screen and there are two buttons  plus and  square root Initially the number 2 is displayed on the screen There are n1 levels in the game and ZS the Coder start at the level 1When ZS the Coder is at level k he can   Press the  button This increases the number on the screen by exactly k So if the number on the screen was x it becomes xk Press the  button Let the number on the screen be x After pressing this button the number becomes  After that ZS the Coder levels up so his current level becomes k1 This button can only be pressed when x is a perfect square ie xm2 for some positive integer m Additionally after each move if ZS the Coder is at level k and the number on the screen is m then m must be a multiple of k Note that this condition is only checked after performing the press For example if ZS the Coder is at level 4 and current number is 100 he presses the  button and the number turns into 10 Note that at this moment 10 is not divisible by 4 but this press is still valid because after it ZS the Coder is at level 5 and 10 is divisible by 5ZS the Coder needs your help in beating the game he wants to reach level n1 In other words he needs to press the  button n times Help him determine the number of times he should press the  button before pressing the  button at each level Please note that ZS the Coder wants to find just any sequence of presses allowing him to reach level n1 but not necessarily a sequence minimizing the number of presses
