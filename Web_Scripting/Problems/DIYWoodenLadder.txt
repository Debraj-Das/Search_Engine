Let's denote a k-step ladder as the following structure: exactly k + 2 wooden planks, of which  two planks of length at least k+1 — the base of the ladder;  k planks of length at least 1 — the steps of the ladder; Note that neither the base planks, nor the steps planks are required to be equal.For example, ladders 1 and 3 are correct 2-step ladders and ladder 2 is a correct 1-step ladder. On the first picture the lengths of planks are [3, 3] for the base and [1] for the step. On the second picture lengths are [3, 3] for the base and [2] for the step. On the third picture lengths are [3, 4] for the base and [2, 3] for the steps.   You have n planks. The length of the i-th planks is a_i. You don't have a saw, so you can't cut the planks you have. Though you have a hammer and nails, so you can assemble the improvised "ladder" from the planks.The question is: what is the maximum number k such that you can choose some subset of the given planks and assemble a k-step ladder using them?
