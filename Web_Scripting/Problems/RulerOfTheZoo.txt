After realizing that Zookeeper is just a duck, the animals have overthrown Zookeeper. They now have to decide a new ruler among themselves through a fighting tournament of the following format:Initially, animal 0 is king, while everyone else queues up with animal 1 at the front of the queue and animal n-1 at the back. The animal at the front of the queue will challenge the king to a fight, and the animal with greater strength will win the fight. The winner will become king, while the loser joins the back of the queue.An animal who wins 3 times consecutively will be crowned ruler for the whole zoo. The strength of each animal depends on how many consecutive fights he won. Animal i has strength A_i with 0 consecutive win, B_i with 1 consecutive win, and C_i with 2 consecutive wins. Initially, everyone has 0 consecutive win.For all animals, A_i > B_i and C_i > B_i. Also, the values of A_i, B_i, C_i are distinct (all 3n values are pairwise different). In other words, an animal who is not a king has strength A_i. A king usually has a strength of B_i or C_i. The exception is on the first turn, the first king (animal 0) has strength A_i.Who is the new ruler, and after how many fights? Or will it end up that animals fight forever with no one ending up as ruler?
