Little Petya is preparing for the first contact with aliens. He knows that alien spaceships have shapes of non-degenerate triangles and there will be exactly 4 ships. Landing platform for a ship can be made of 3 special columns located at some points of a Cartesian plane such that these 3 points form a triangle equal to the ship with respect to rotations, translations (parallel shifts along some vector) and reflections (symmetries along the edges). The ships can overlap after the landing.Each column can be used to land more than one ship, for example, if there are two equal ships, we don't need to build 6 columns to land both ships, 3 will be enough. Petya wants to know what minimum number of columns will be enough to land all ships.
