Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob is struggling with his homework – a number division problem.There are n positive integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on Bob's homework paper, where n is always an even number. Bob is asked to divide those numbers into groups, where each group must contain at least 2 numbers. Suppose the numbers are divided into m groups, and the sum of the numbers in the j-th group is s_j. Bob's aim is to minimize the sum of the square of s_j, that is \sum_{j = 1}^{m} s_j^2.Bob is puzzled by this hard problem. Could you please help him solve it?
