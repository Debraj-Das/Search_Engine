Let us remind you part of the rules of Codeforces. The given rules slightly simplified, use the problem statement as a formal document.In the beginning of the round the contestants are divided into rooms. Each room contains exactly n participants. During the contest the participants are suggested to solve five problems, A, B, C, D and E. For each of these problem, depending on when the given problem was solved and whether it was solved at all, the participants receive some points. Besides, a contestant can perform hacks on other contestants. For each successful hack a contestant earns 100 points, for each unsuccessful hack a contestant loses 50 points. The number of points for every contestant is represented by the sum of points he has received from all his problems, including hacks.You are suggested to determine the leader for some room; the leader is a participant who has maximum points.
