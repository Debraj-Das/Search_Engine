Emuskald is an avid horticulturist and owns the worlds longest greenhouse  it is effectively infinite in lengthOver the years Emuskald has cultivated n plants in his greenhouse of m different plant species numbered from 1 to m His greenhouse is very narrow and can be viewed as an infinite line with each plant occupying a single point on that lineEmuskald has discovered that each species thrives at a different temperature so he wants to arrange m1 borders that would divide the greenhouse into m sections numbered from 1 to m from left to right with each section housing a single species He is free to place the borders but in the end all of the ith species plants must reside in ith section from the leftOf course it is not always possible to place the borders in such way so Emuskald needs to replant some of his plants He can remove each plant from its position and place it anywhere in the greenhouse at any real coordinate with no plant already in it Since replanting is a lot of stress for the plants help Emuskald find the minimum number of plants he has to replant to be able to place the borders
