John Doe started thinking about graphs. After some thought he decided that he wants to paint an undirected graph, containing exactly k cycles of length 3. A cycle of length 3 is an unordered group of three distinct graph vertices a, b and c, such that each pair of them is connected by a graph edge. John has been painting for long, but he has not been a success. Help him find such graph. Note that the number of vertices there shouldn't exceed 100, or else John will have problems painting it.
