You have a long stick, consisting of m segments enumerated from 1 to m. Each segment is 1 centimeter long. Sadly, some segments are broken and need to be repaired.You have an infinitely long repair tape. You want to cut some pieces from the tape and use them to cover all of the broken segments. To be precise, a piece of tape of integer length t placed at some position s will cover segments s, s+1, \ldots, s+t-1.You are allowed to cover non-broken segments; it is also possible that some pieces of tape will overlap.Time is money, so you want to cut at most k continuous pieces of tape to cover all the broken segments. What is the minimum total length of these pieces?
