Let a and b be some non-negative integers. Let's define strange addition of a and b as following:  write down the numbers one under another and align them by their least significant digit;  add them up digit by digit and concatenate the respective sums together. Assume that both numbers have an infinite number of leading zeros.For example, let's take a look at a strange addition of numbers 3248 and 908:  You are given a string c, consisting of n digits from 0 to 9. You are also given m updates of form:   x~d — replace the digit at the x-th position of c with a digit d. Note that string c might have leading zeros at any point of time.After each update print the number of pairs (a, b) such that both a and b are non-negative integers and the result of a strange addition of a and b is equal to c.Note that the numbers of pairs can be quite large, so print them modulo 998244353.
