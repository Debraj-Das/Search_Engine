Professional sport is more than hard work It also is the equipment designed by top engineers As an example lets take tennis Not only should you be in great shape you also need an excellent racket In this problem your task is to contribute to the development of tennis and to help to design a revolutionary new concept of a racketThe concept is a triangular racket Ant it should be not just any triangle but a regular one As soon as youve chosen the shape you need to stretch the net By the time you came the rocket had n holes drilled on each of its sides The holes divide each side into equal n1 parts At that the m closest to each apex holes on each side are made for better ventilation only and you cannot stretch the net through them The next revolutionary idea as to stretch the net as obtuse triangles through the holes so that for each triangle all apexes lay on different sides Moreover you need the net to be stretched along every possible obtuse triangle Thats where we need your help  help us to count the number of triangles the net is going to consist ofTwo triangles are considered to be different if their pictures on the fixed at some position racket are different
