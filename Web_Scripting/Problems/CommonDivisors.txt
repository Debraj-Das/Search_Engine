Vasya has recently learned at school what a number's divisor is and decided to determine a string's divisor. Here is what he came up with.String a is the divisor of string b if and only if there exists a positive integer x such that if we write out string a consecutively x times, we get string b. For example, string "abab" has two divisors — "ab" and "abab".Now Vasya wants to write a program that calculates the number of common divisors of two strings. Please help him.
