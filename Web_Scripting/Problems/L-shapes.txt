An L-shape is a figure on gridded paper that looks like the first four pictures below. An L-shape contains exactly three shaded cells (denoted by *), which can be rotated in any way.  You are given a rectangular grid. Determine if it contains L-shapes only, where L-shapes can't touch an edge or corner. More formally:   Each shaded cell in the grid is part of exactly one L-shape, and  no two L-shapes are adjacent by edge or corner. For example, the last two grids in the picture above do not satisfy the condition because the two L-shapes touch by corner and edge, respectively.
