You have a rooted tree consisting of n vertices Lets number them with integers from 1 to n inclusive The root of the tree is the vertex 1 For each i1 direct parent of the vertex i is pi We say that vertex i is child for its direct parent piYou have initially painted all the vertices with red color You like to repaint some vertices of the tree To perform painting you use the function paint that you call with the root of the tree as an argument Here is the pseudocode of this functioncount  0  global integer variable rnd   this function is used in paint code    return 0 or 1 equiprobablypaints     if count is even then paint s with white color    else paint s with black color    count  count  1        if rnd  1 then children  array of vertex s children in ascending order of their numbers    else children  array of vertex s children in descending order of their numbers    for child in children   iterating over children array        if rnd  1 then paintchild  calling paint recursively    As a result of this function some vertices may change their colors to white or black and some of them may remain redYour task is to determine the number of distinct possible colorings of the vertices of the tree We will assume that the coloring is possible if there is a nonzero probability to get this coloring with a single call of paint1 We assume that the colorings are different if there is a pair of vertices that are painted with different colors in these colorings Since the required number may be very large find its remainder of division by 1000000007 1097
