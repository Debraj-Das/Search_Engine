A string t is called an anagram of the string s, if it is possible to rearrange letters in t so that it is identical to the string s. For example, the string "aab" is an anagram of the string "aba" and the string "aaa" is not.The string t is called a substring of the string s if it can be read starting from some position in the string s. For example, the string "aba" has six substrings: "a", "b", "a", "ab", "ba", "aba".You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters "?". You are also given a string p, consisting of lowercase Latin letters only. Let's assume that a string is good if you can obtain an anagram of the string p from it, replacing the "?" characters by Latin letters. Each "?" can be replaced by exactly one character of the Latin alphabet. For example, if the string p = «aba», then the string "a??" is good, and the string «?bc» is not. Your task is to find the number of good substrings of the string s (identical substrings must be counted in the answer several times).
