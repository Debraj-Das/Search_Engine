Let's define a function f(x) (x is a positive integer) as follows: write all digits of the decimal representation of x backwards, then get rid of the leading zeroes. For example, f(321) = 123, f(120) = 21, f(1000000) = 1, f(111) = 111.Let's define another function g(x) = \dfrac{x}{f(f(x))} (x is a positive integer as well).Your task is the following: for the given positive integer n, calculate the number of different values of g(x) among all numbers x such that 1 \le x \le n.
