  William has two numbers a and b initially both equal to zero. William mastered performing three different operations with them quickly. Before performing each operation some positive integer k is picked, which is then used to perform one of the following operations: (note, that for each operation you can choose a new positive integer k)  add number k to both a and b, or  add number k to a and subtract k from b, or  add number k to b and subtract k from a. Note that after performing operations, numbers a and b may become negative as well.William wants to find out the minimal number of operations he would have to perform to make a equal to his favorite number c and b equal to his second favorite number d.
