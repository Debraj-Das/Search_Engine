You are given a tree with n vertices numbered from 1 to n. The height of the i-th vertex is h_i. You can place any number of towers into vertices, for each tower you can choose which vertex to put it in, as well as choose its efficiency. Setting up a tower with efficiency e costs e coins, where e > 0.It is considered that a vertex x gets a signal if for some pair of towers at the vertices u and v (u \neq v, but it is allowed that x = u or x = v) with efficiencies e_u and e_v, respectively, it is satisfied that \min(e_u, e_v) \geq h_x and x lies on the path between u and v.Find the minimum number of coins required to set up towers so that you can get a signal at all vertices.
