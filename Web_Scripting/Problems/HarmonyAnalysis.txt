The semester is already ending so Danil made an effort and decided to visit a lesson on harmony analysis to know how does the professor look like at least Danil was very bored on this lesson until the teacher gave the group a simple task find 4 vectors in 4dimensional space such that every coordinate of every vector is 1 or 1 and any two vectors are orthogonal Just as a reminder two vectors in ndimensional space are considered to be orthogonal if and only if their scalar product is equal to zero that is Danil quickly managed to come up with the solution for this problem and the teacher noticed that the problem can be solved in a more general case for 2k vectors in 2kdimensinoal space When Danil came home he quickly came up with the solution for this problem Can you cope with it
