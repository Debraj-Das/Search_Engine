It is a simplified version of problem F2. The difference between them is the constraints (F1: k \le 2, F2: k \le 10).You are given an integer n. Find the minimum integer x such that x \ge n and the number x is k-beautiful.A number is called k-beautiful if its decimal representation having no leading zeroes contains no more than k different digits. E.g. if k = 2, the numbers 3434443, 55550, 777 and 21 are k-beautiful whereas the numbers 120, 445435 and 998244353 are not.
