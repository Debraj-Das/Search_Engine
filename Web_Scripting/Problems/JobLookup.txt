Julia's n friends want to organize a startup in a new country they moved to. They assigned each other numbers from 1 to n according to the jobs they have, from the most front-end tasks to the most back-end ones. They also estimated a matrix c, where c_{ij} = c_{ji} is the average number of messages per month between people doing jobs i and j.Now they want to make a hierarchy tree. It will be a binary tree with each node containing one member of the team. Some member will be selected as a leader of the team and will be contained in the root node. In order for the leader to be able to easily reach any subordinate, for each node v of the tree, the following should apply: all members in its left subtree must have smaller numbers than v, and all members in its right subtree must have larger numbers than v.After the hierarchy tree is settled, people doing jobs i and j will be communicating via the shortest path in the tree between their nodes. Let's denote the length of this path as d_{ij}. Thus, the cost of their communication is c_{ij} \cdot d_{ij}.Your task is to find a hierarchy tree that minimizes the total cost of communication over all pairs: \sum_{1 \le i < j \le n} c_{ij} \cdot d_{ij}.
