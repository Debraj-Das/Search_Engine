Mad scientist Mike has applied for a job His task is to manage a system of water pumping stationsThe system consists of n pumping stations which are numbered by integers from 1 to n Some pairs of stations are connected by bidirectional pipes through which water can flow in either direction but only in one at a time For each pipe you know its bandwidth  the maximum number of liters of water that can flow through it in one hour Each pumping station can pump incoming water from some stations to other stations through the pipes provided that in one hour the total influx of water to the station is equal to the total outflux of water from the stationIt is Mikes responsibility to pump water between stations From station a to station b through the pipes possibly through other stations within one hour one can transmit a certain number of liters of water according to the rules described above During this time water from other stations can not flow into station a and can not flow out of the station b However any amount of water can flow out of station a or in station b If a total of x litres of water flows out of the station a in an hour then Mike gets x bollars more to his salaryTo get paid Mike needs to work for n1 days according to the contract On the first day he selects two stations v1 and v2 and within one hour he pumps a certain amount of water from v1 to v2 Next on the ith day Mike chooses a station vi1 that has been never selected before and pumps a certain amount of water out of the station vi to station vi1 for one hour The quantity of water he pumps on the ith day does not depend on the amount of water pumped on the i1th dayMike needs to earn as much bollars as he can for his projects Help Mike find such a permutation of station numbers v1 v2  vn so Mike will be able to earn the highest possible salary
