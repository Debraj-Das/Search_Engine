You all know that the Library of Bookland is the largest library in the world There are dozens of thousands of books in the librarySome long and uninteresting story was removedThe alphabet of Bookland is so large that its letters are denoted by positive integers Each letter can be small or large the large version of a letter x is denoted by x BSCII encoding which is used everywhere in Bookland is made in that way so that large letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by and small letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by but all large letters are before all small letters For example the following conditions hold 23 23 32A word x1x2xa is not lexicographically greater than y1y2yb if one of the two following conditions holds   ab and x1y1xaya ie the first word is the prefix of the second word  there is a position 1jminab such that x1y1xj1yj1 and xjyj ie at the first position where the words differ the first word has a smaller letter than the second word has  For example the word 3 7 5 is before the word 2 4 6 in lexicographical order It is said that sequence of words is in lexicographical order if each word is not lexicographically greater than the next word in the sequenceDenis has a sequence of words consisting of small letters only He wants to change some letters to large lets call this process a capitalization in such a way that the sequence of words is in lexicographical order However he soon realized that for some reason he cant change a single letter in a single word He only can choose a letter and change all of its occurrences in all words to large letters He can perform this operation any number of times with arbitrary letters of Booklands alphabetHelp Denis to choose which letters he needs to capitalize make large in order to make the sequence of words lexicographically ordered or determine that it is impossibleNote that some words can be equal
