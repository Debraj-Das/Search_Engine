In this task Anna and Maria play a game with a very unpleasant rival Anna and Maria are in the opposite squares of a chessboard 88 Anna is in the upper right corner and Maria is in the lower left one Apart from them the board has several statues Each statue occupies exactly one square A square that contains a statue cannot have anything or anyone  neither any other statues nor Anna nor MariaAnna is present on the board as a figurant she stands still and never moves and Maria has been actively involved in the game Her goal is  to come to Annas square Maria and statues move in turn Maria moves first During one move Maria can go to any adjacent on the side or diagonal cell in which there is no statue or she can stay in the cell where she is The statues during their move must go one square down simultaneously and those statues that were in the bottom row fall from the board and are no longer appearedAt that moment when one of the statues is in the cell in which the Maria is the statues are declared winners At the moment when Maria comes into the cell where Anna has been waiting Maria is declared the winnerObviously nothing depends on the statues so it all depends on Maria Determine who will win if Maria does not make a strategic error
