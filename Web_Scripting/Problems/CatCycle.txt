Suppose you are living with two cats: A and B. There are n napping spots where both cats usually sleep.Your cats like to sleep and also like all these spots, so they change napping spot each hour cyclically:   Cat A changes its napping place in order: n, n - 1, n - 2, \dots, 3, 2, 1, n, n - 1, \dots In other words, at the first hour it's on the spot n and then goes in decreasing order cyclically;  Cat B changes its napping place in order: 1, 2, 3, \dots, n - 1, n, 1, 2, \dots In other words, at the first hour it's on the spot 1 and then goes in increasing order cyclically. The cat B is much younger, so they have a strict hierarchy: A and B don't lie together. In other words, if both cats'd like to go in spot x then the A takes this place and B moves to the next place in its order (if x < n then to x + 1, but if x = n then to 1). Cat B follows his order, so it won't return to the skipped spot x after A frees it, but will move to the spot x + 2 and so on.Calculate, where cat B will be at hour k?
