You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n, which is sorted in non-decreasing order (a_i \le a_{i + 1}). Find three indices i, j, k such that 1 \le i < j < k \le n and it is impossible to construct a non-degenerate triangle (a triangle with nonzero area) having sides equal to a_i, a_j and a_k (for example it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle with sides 3, 4 and 5 but impossible with sides 3, 4 and 7). If it is impossible to find such triple, report it.
