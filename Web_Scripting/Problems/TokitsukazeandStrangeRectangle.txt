There are n points on the plane, the i-th of which is at (x_i, y_i). Tokitsukaze wants to draw a strange rectangular area and pick all the points in the area.The strange area is enclosed by three lines, x = l, y = a and x = r, as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where l, r and a can be any real numbers satisfying that l < r. The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the x-axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area.  A point (x_i, y_i) is in the strange rectangular area if and only if l < x_i < r and y_i > a. For example, in the above figure, p_1 is in the area while p_2 is not.Tokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.
