You are given a positive integer x. Find any such 2 positive integers a and b such that GCD(a,b)+LCM(a,b)=x.As a reminder, GCD(a,b) is the greatest integer that divides both a and b. Similarly, LCM(a,b) is the smallest integer such that both a and b divide it.It's guaranteed that the solution always exists. If there are several such pairs (a, b), you can output any of them.
