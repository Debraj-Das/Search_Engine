Mihai has just learned about the MEX concept and since he liked it so much, he decided to use it right away.Given an array a of n non-negative integers, Mihai wants to create a new array b that is formed in the following way:While a is not empty:   Choose an integer k (1 \leq k \leq |a|).  Append the MEX of the first k numbers of the array a to the end of array b and erase them from the array a, shifting the positions of the remaining numbers in a. But, since Mihai loves big arrays as much as the MEX concept, he wants the new array b to be the lexicographically maximum. So, Mihai asks you to tell him what the maximum array b that can be created by constructing the array optimally is.An array x is lexicographically greater than an array y if in the first position where x and y differ x_i > y_i or if |x| > |y| and y is a prefix of x (where |x| denotes the size of the array x).The MEX of a set of non-negative integers is the minimal non-negative integer such that it is not in the set. For example, MEX({{1, 2, 3}}) = 0 and MEX({{0, 1, 2, 4, 5}}) = 3.
