Polycarp plays "Game 23". Initially he has a number n and his goal is to transform it to m. In one move, he can multiply n by 2 or multiply n by 3. He can perform any number of moves.Print the number of moves needed to transform n to m. Print -1 if it is impossible to do so.It is easy to prove that any way to transform n to m contains the same number of moves (i.e. number of moves doesn't depend on the way of transformation).
