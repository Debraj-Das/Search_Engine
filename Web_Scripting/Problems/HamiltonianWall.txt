Sir Monocarp Hamilton is planning to paint his wall. The wall can be represented as a grid, consisting of 2 rows and m columns. Initially, the wall is completely white.Monocarp wants to paint a black picture on the wall. In particular, he wants cell (i, j) (the j-th cell in the i-th row) to be colored black, if c_{i, j} = 'B', and to be left white, if c_{i, j} = 'W'. Additionally, he wants each column to have at least one black cell, so, for each j, the following constraint is satisfied: c_{1, j}, c_{2, j} or both of them will be equal to 'B'.In order for the picture to turn out smooth, Monocarp wants to place down a paint brush in some cell (x_1, y_1) and move it along the path (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_k, y_k) so that:   for each i, (x_i, y_i) and (x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) share a common side;  all black cells appear in the path exactly once;  white cells don't appear in the path. Determine if Monocarp can paint the wall.
