George loves graphs Most of all he loves interesting graphs We will assume that a directed graph is interesting if it meets the following criteria   The graph doesnt contain any multiple arcs  There is vertex v well call her the center such that for any vertex of graph u the graph contains arcs uv and vu Please note that the graph also contains loop vv  The outdegree of all vertexes except for the center equals two and the indegree of all vertexes except for the center equals two The outdegree of vertex u is the number of arcs that go out of u the indegree of vertex u is the number of arcs that go in u Please note that the graph can contain loops However not everythings that simple George got a directed graph of n vertices and m arcs as a present The graph didnt have any multiple arcs As George loves interesting graphs he wants to slightly alter the presented graph and transform it into an interesting one In one alteration he can either remove an arbitrary existing arc from the graph or add an arbitrary arc to the graph George wonders what is the minimum number of changes that he needs to obtain an interesting graph from the graph hes got as a present Help George and find the answer to the question
