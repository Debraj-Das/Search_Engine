Omkar is creating a mosaic using colored square tiles, which he places in an n \times n grid. When the mosaic is complete, each cell in the grid will have either a glaucous or sinoper tile. However, currently he has only placed tiles in some cells. A completed mosaic will be a mastapeece if and only if each tile is adjacent to exactly 2 tiles of the same color (2 tiles are adjacent if they share a side.) Omkar wants to fill the rest of the tiles so that the mosaic becomes a mastapeece. Now he is wondering, is the way to do this unique, and if it is, what is it?
