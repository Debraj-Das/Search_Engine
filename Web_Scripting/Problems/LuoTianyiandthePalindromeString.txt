LuoTianyi gives you a palindrome^{\dagger} string s, and she wants you to find out the length of the longest non-empty subsequence^{\ddagger} of s which is not a palindrome string. If there is no such subsequence, output -1 instead.^{\dagger} A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, strings "z", "aaa", "aba", "abccba" are palindromes, but strings "codeforces", "reality", "ab" are not.^{\ddagger} A string a is a subsequence of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from b. For example, strings "a", "aaa", "bab" are subsequences of string "abaab", but strings "codeforces", "bbb", "h" are not.
