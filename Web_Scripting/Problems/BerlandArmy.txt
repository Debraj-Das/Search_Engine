There are n military men in the Berland army. Some of them have given orders to other military men by now. Given m pairs (xi, yi), meaning that the military man xi gave the i-th order to another military man yi.It is time for reform! The Berland Ministry of Defence plans to introduce ranks in the Berland army. Each military man should be assigned a rank — integer number between 1 and k, inclusive. Some of them have been already assigned a rank, but the rest of them should get a rank soon.Help the ministry to assign ranks to the rest of the army so that:  for each of m orders it is true that the rank of a person giving the order (military man xi) is strictly greater than the rank of a person receiving the order (military man yi);  for each rank from 1 to k there is at least one military man with this rank.
