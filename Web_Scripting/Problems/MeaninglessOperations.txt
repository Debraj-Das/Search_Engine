Can the greatest common divisor and bitwise operations have anything in common? It is time to answer this question.Suppose you are given a positive integer a. You want to choose some integer b from 1 to a - 1 inclusive in such a way that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers a \oplus b and a \> \& \> b is as large as possible. In other words, you'd like to compute the following function:f(a) = \max_{0 < b < a}{gcd(a \oplus b, a \> \& \> b)}.Here \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation, and \& denotes the bitwise AND operation.The greatest common divisor of two integers x and y is the largest integer g such that both x and y are divided by g without remainder.You are given q integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_q. For each of these integers compute the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor (when b is chosen optimally).
