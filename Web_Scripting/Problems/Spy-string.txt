You are given n strings a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n: all of them have the same length m. The strings consist of lowercase English letters.Find any string s of length m such that each of the given n strings differs from s in at most one position. Formally, for each given string a_i, there is no more than one position j such that a_i[j] \ne s[j].Note that the desired string s may be equal to one of the given strings a_i, or it may differ from all the given strings.For example, if you have the strings abac and zbab, then the answer to the problem might be the string abab, which differs from the first only by the last character, and from the second only by the first.
