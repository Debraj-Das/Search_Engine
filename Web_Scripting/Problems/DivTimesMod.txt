Vasya likes to solve equations. Today he wants to solve (x~\mathrm{div}~k) \cdot (x \bmod k) = n, where \mathrm{div} and \mathrm{mod} stand for integer division and modulo operations (refer to the Notes below for exact definition). In this equation, k and n are positive integer parameters, and x is a positive integer unknown. If there are several solutions, Vasya wants to find the smallest possible x. Can you help him?
