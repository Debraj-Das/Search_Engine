You are given a tree consisting exactly of n vertices. Tree is a connected undirected graph with n-1 edges. Each vertex v of this tree has a value a_v assigned to it.Let dist(x, y) be the distance between the vertices x and y. The distance between the vertices is the number of edges on the simple path between them.Let's define the cost of the tree as the following value: firstly, let's fix some vertex of the tree. Let it be v. Then the cost of the tree is \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} dist(i, v) \cdot a_i.Your task is to calculate the maximum possible cost of the tree if you can choose v arbitrarily.
