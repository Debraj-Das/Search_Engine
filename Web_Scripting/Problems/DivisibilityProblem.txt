You are given two positive integers a and b. In one move you can increase a by 1 (replace a with a+1). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b. It is possible, that you have to make 0 moves, as a is already divisible by b. You have to answer t independent test cases.
