You are given an array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n of integer numbers.Your task is to divide the array into the maximum number of segments in such a way that:  each element is contained in exactly one segment;  each segment contains at least one element;  there doesn't exist a non-empty subset of segments such that bitwise XOR of the numbers from them is equal to 0. Print the maximum number of segments the array can be divided into. Print -1 if no suitable division exists.
