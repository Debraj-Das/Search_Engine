Some days ago, WJMZBMR learned how to answer the query "how many times does a string x occur in a string s" quickly by preprocessing the string s. But now he wants to make it harder.So he wants to ask "how many consecutive substrings of s are cyclical isomorphic to a given string x". You are given string s and n strings xi, for each string xi find, how many consecutive substrings of s are cyclical isomorphic to xi.Two strings are called cyclical isomorphic if one can rotate one string to get the other one. 'Rotate' here means 'to take some consecutive chars (maybe none) from the beginning of a string and put them back at the end of the string in the same order'. For example, string "abcde" can be rotated to string "deabc". We can take characters "abc" from the beginning and put them at the end of "de".
