The Berlands capital has the form of a rectangle with sizes nm quarters All quarters are divided into three types  regular labeled with the character   such quarters do not produce the noise but are not obstacles to the propagation of the noise  sources of noise labeled with an uppercase Latin letter from A to Z  such quarters are noise sources and are not obstacles to the propagation of the noise  heavily builtup labeled with the character   such quarters are soundproofed the noise does not penetrate into them and they themselves are obstacles to the propagation of noise A quarter labeled with letter A produces q units of noise A quarter labeled with letter B produces 2q units of noise And so on up to a quarter labeled with letter Z which produces 26q units of noise There can be any number of quarters labeled with each letter in the cityWhen propagating from the source of the noise the noise level is halved when moving from one quarter to a quarter that shares a side with it when an odd number is to be halved its rounded down The noise spreads along the chain For example if some quarter is located at a distance 2 from the noise source then the value of noise which will reach the quarter is divided by 4 So the noise level that comes from the source to the quarter is determined solely by the length of the shortest path between them Heavily builtup quarters are obstacles the noise does not penetrate into them  The values in the cells of the table on the right show the total noise level in the respective quarters for q100 the first term in each sum is the noise from the quarter A the second  the noise from the quarter B The noise level in quarter is defined as the sum of the noise from all sources To assess the quality of life of the population of the capital of Berland it is required to find the number of quarters whose noise level exceeds the allowed level p
