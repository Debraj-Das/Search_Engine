You have a rectangular grid of height 2 and width 10^9 consisting of unit cells. There are n rectangles placed on this grid, and the borders of these rectangles pass along cell borders. The i-th rectangle covers all cells in rows from u_i to d_i inclusive and columns from l_i to r_i inclusive (1 \le u_i \le d_i \le 2; 1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^9). The initial rectangles can intersect, be nested, and coincide arbitrarily.You should either remove each rectangle, or replace it with any of its non-empty subrectangles. In the latter case, the new subrectangle must lie inside the initial rectangle, and its borders must still pass along cell borders. In particular, it is allowed for the subrectangle to be equal to the initial rectangle.After that replacement, no two (non-removed) rectangles are allowed to have common cells, and the total area covered with the new rectangles must be as large as possible.  Illustration for the first test case. The initial rectangles are given at the top, the new rectangles are given at the bottom. Rectangle number 4 is removed.
