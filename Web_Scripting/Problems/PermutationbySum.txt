A permutation is a sequence of n integers from 1 to n, in which all the numbers occur exactly once. For example, [1], [3, 5, 2, 1, 4], [1, 3, 2] are permutations, and [2, 3, 2], [4, 3, 1], [0] are not.Polycarp was given four integers n, l, r (1 \le l \le r \le n) and s (1 \le s \le \frac{n (n+1)}{2}) and asked to find a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n that satisfies the following condition:   s = p_l + p_{l+1} + \ldots + p_r. For example, for n=5, l=3, r=5, and s=8, the following permutations are suitable (not all options are listed):   p = [3, 4, 5, 2, 1];  p = [5, 2, 4, 3, 1];  p = [5, 2, 1, 3, 4].  But, for example, there is no permutation suitable for the condition above for n=4, l=1, r=1, and s=5.Help Polycarp, for the given n, l, r, and s, find a permutation of numbers from 1 to n that fits the condition above. If there are several suitable permutations, print any of them.
