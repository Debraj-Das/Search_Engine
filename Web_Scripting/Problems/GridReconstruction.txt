Consider a 2 \times n grid, where n is an even integer. You may place the integers 1, 2, \ldots, 2n on the grid, using each integer exactly once.A path is a sequence of cells achieved by starting at (1, 1), then repeatedly walking either downwards or to the right, and stopping when (2, n) is reached. The path should not extend beyond the grid.The cost of a path is the alternating sum of the numbers written on the cells in a path. That is, let the numbers written on the cells be a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k (in the order that it is visited), the cost of the path is a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + \ldots = \sum_{i=1}^k a_i \cdot (-1)^{i+1}.Construct a way to place the integers 1, 2, \ldots, 2n on the grid, such that the minimum cost over all paths from (1, 1) to (2, n) is maximized. If there are multiple such grids that result in the maximum value, output any of them.
