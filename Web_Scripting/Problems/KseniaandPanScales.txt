Ksenia has ordinary pan scales and several weights of an equal mass. Ksenia has already put some weights on the scales, while other weights are untouched. Ksenia is now wondering whether it is possible to put all the remaining weights on the scales so that the scales were in equilibrium. The scales is in equilibrium if the total sum of weights on the left pan is equal to the total sum of weights on the right pan.
