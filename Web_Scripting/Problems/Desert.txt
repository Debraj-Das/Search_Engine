You are given an undirected graph of N nodes and M edges, E_1, E_2, \dots E_M.A connected graph is a cactus if each of it's edges belogs to at most one simple cycle. A graph is a desert if each of it's connected components is a cactus. Find the number of pairs (L, R), (1 \leq L \leq R \leq M) such that, if we delete all the edges except for E_L, E_{L+1}, \dots E_R, the graph is a desert.
