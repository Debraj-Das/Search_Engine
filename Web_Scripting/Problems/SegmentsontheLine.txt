You are a given a list of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n and s of its segments [l_j; r_j] (where 1 \le l_j \le r_j \le n).You need to select exactly m segments in such a way that the k-th order statistic of the multiset of a_i, where i is contained in at least one segment, is the smallest possible. If it's impossible to select a set of m segments in such a way that the multiset contains at least k elements, print -1.The k-th order statistic of a multiset is the value of the k-th element after sorting the multiset in non-descending order.
