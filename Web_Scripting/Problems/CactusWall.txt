Monocarp is playing Minecraft and wants to build a wall of cacti. He wants to build it on a field of sand of the size of n \times m cells. Initially, there are cacti in some cells of the field. Note that, in Minecraft, cacti cannot grow on cells adjacent to each other by side — and the initial field meets this restriction. Monocarp can plant new cacti (they must also fulfil the aforementioned condition). He can't chop down any of the cacti that are already growing on the field — he doesn't have an axe, and the cacti are too prickly for his hands.Monocarp believes that the wall is complete if there is no path from the top row of the field to the bottom row, such that:   each two consecutive cells in the path are adjacent by side;  no cell belonging to the path contains a cactus. Your task is to plant the minimum number of cacti to build a wall (or to report that this is impossible).
