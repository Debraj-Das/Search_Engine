There are n points on the plane, (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \ldots, (x_n,y_n).You need to place an isosceles triangle with two sides on the coordinate axis to cover all points (a point is covered if it lies inside the triangle or on the side of the triangle). Calculate the minimum length of the shorter side of the triangle.
