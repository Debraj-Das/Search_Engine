You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths A, B and C. Find the number of different groups of three integers (a, b, c) such that 1\leq a\leq b\leq c and parallelepiped A\times B\times C can be paved with parallelepipeds a\times b\times c. Note, that all small parallelepipeds have to be rotated in the same direction.For example, parallelepiped 1\times 5\times 6 can be divided into parallelepipeds 1\times 3\times 5, but can not be divided into parallelepipeds 1\times 2\times 3.
