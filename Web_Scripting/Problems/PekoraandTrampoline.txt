There is a trampoline park with n trampolines in a line. The i-th of which has strength S_i.Pekora can jump on trampolines in multiple passes. She starts the pass by jumping on any trampoline of her choice. If at the moment Pekora jumps on trampoline i, the trampoline will launch her to position i + S_i, and S_i will become equal to \max(S_i-1,1). In other words, S_i will decrease by 1, except of the case S_i=1, when S_i will remain equal to 1. If there is no trampoline in position i + S_i, then this pass is over. Otherwise, Pekora will continue the pass by jumping from the trampoline at position i + S_i by the same rule as above.Pekora can't stop jumping during the pass until she lands at the position larger than n (in which there is no trampoline). Poor Pekora!Pekora is a naughty rabbit and wants to ruin the trampoline park by reducing all S_i to 1. What is the minimum number of passes she needs to reduce all S_i to 1?
