You have a permutation: an array a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] of distinct integers from 1 to n. The length of the permutation n is odd.Consider the following algorithm of sorting the permutation in increasing order.A helper procedure of the algorithm, f(i), takes a single argument i (1 \le i \le n-1) and does the following. If a_i > a_{i+1}, the values of a_i and a_{i+1} are exchanged. Otherwise, the permutation doesn't change.The algorithm consists of iterations, numbered with consecutive integers starting with 1. On the i-th iteration, the algorithm does the following:   if i is odd, call f(1), f(3), \ldots, f(n - 2);  if i is even, call f(2), f(4), \ldots, f(n - 1). It can be proven that after a finite number of iterations the permutation will be sorted in increasing order.After how many iterations will this happen for the first time?
