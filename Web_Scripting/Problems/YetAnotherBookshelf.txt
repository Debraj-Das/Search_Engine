There is a bookshelf which can fit n books. The i-th position of bookshelf is a_i = 1 if there is a book on this position and a_i = 0 otherwise. It is guaranteed that there is at least one book on the bookshelf.In one move, you can choose some contiguous segment [l; r] consisting of books (i.e. for each i from l to r the condition a_i = 1 holds) and:  Shift it to the right by 1: move the book at index i to i + 1 for all l \le i \le r. This move can be done only if r+1 \le n and there is no book at the position r+1.  Shift it to the left by 1: move the book at index i to i-1 for all l \le i \le r. This move can be done only if l-1 \ge 1 and there is no book at the position l-1. Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to collect all the books on the shelf as a contiguous (consecutive) segment (i.e. the segment without any gaps).For example, for a = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] there is a gap between books (a_4 = 0 when a_3 = 1 and a_5 = 1), for a = [1, 1, 0] there are no gaps between books and for a = [0, 0,0] there are also no gaps between books.You have to answer t independent test cases.
