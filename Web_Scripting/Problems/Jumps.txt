You are standing on the \mathit{OX}-axis at point 0 and you want to move to an integer point x > 0.You can make several jumps. Suppose you're currently at point y (y may be negative) and jump for the k-th time. You can:   either jump to the point y + k  or jump to the point y - 1. What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point x?
