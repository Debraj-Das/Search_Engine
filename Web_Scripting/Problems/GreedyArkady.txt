k people want to split n candies between them. Each candy should be given to exactly one of them or be thrown away.The people are numbered from 1 to k, and Arkady is the first of them. To split the candies, Arkady will choose an integer x and then give the first x candies to himself, the next x candies to the second person, the next x candies to the third person and so on in a cycle. The leftover (the remainder that is not divisible by x) will be thrown away.Arkady can't choose x greater than M as it is considered greedy. Also, he can't choose such a small x that some person will receive candies more than D times, as it is considered a slow splitting.Please find what is the maximum number of candies Arkady can receive by choosing some valid x.
