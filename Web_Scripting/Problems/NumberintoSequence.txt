You are given an integer n (n > 1).Your task is to find a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k such that:  each a_i is strictly greater than 1;  a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_k = n (i. e. the product of this sequence is n);  a_{i + 1} is divisible by a_i for each i from 1 to k-1;  k is the maximum possible (i. e. the length of this sequence is the maximum possible). If there are several such sequences, any of them is acceptable. It can be proven that at least one valid sequence always exists for any integer n > 1.You have to answer t independent test cases.
