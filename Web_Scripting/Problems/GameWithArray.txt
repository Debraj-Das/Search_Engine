Petya and Vasya are competing with each other in a new interesting game as they always do.At the beginning of the game Petya has to come up with an array of N positive integers. Sum of all elements in his array should be equal to S. Then Petya has to select an integer K such that 0 \leq K \leq S.In order to win, Vasya has to find a non-empty subarray in Petya's array such that the sum of all selected elements equals to either K or S - K. Otherwise Vasya loses.You are given integers N and S. You should determine if Petya can win, considering Vasya plays optimally. If Petya can win, help him to do that.
