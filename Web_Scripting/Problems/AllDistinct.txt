Sho has an array a consisting of n integers. An operation consists of choosing two distinct indices i and j and removing a_i and a_j from the array.For example, for the array [2, 3, 4, 2, 5], Sho can choose to remove indices 1 and 3. After this operation, the array becomes [3, 2, 5]. Note that after any operation, the length of the array is reduced by two.After he made some operations, Sho has an array that has only distinct elements. In addition, he made operations such that the resulting array is the longest possible. More formally, the array after Sho has made his operations respects these criteria:   No pairs such that (i < j) and a_i = a_j exist.  The length of a is maximized. Output the length of the final array.
