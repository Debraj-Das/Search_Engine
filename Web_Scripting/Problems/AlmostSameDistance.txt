Let G be a simple graph. Let W be a non-empty subset of vertices. Then W is almost-k-uniform if for each pair of distinct vertices u,v \in W the distance between u and v is either k or k+1.You are given a tree on n vertices. For each i between 1 and n, find the maximum size of an almost-i-uniform set.
