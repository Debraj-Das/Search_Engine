n towns are arranged in a circle sequentially. The towns are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. In the i-th town, there lives a singer with a repertoire of a_i minutes for each i \in [1, n].Each singer visited all n towns in clockwise order, starting with the town he lives in, and gave exactly one concert in each town. In addition, in each town, the i-th singer got inspired and came up with a song that lasts a_i minutes. The song was added to his repertoire so that he could perform it in the rest of the cities.Hence, for the i-th singer, the concert in the i-th town will last a_i minutes, in the (i + 1)-th town the concert will last 2 \cdot a_i minutes, ..., in the ((i + k) \bmod n + 1)-th town the duration of the concert will be (k + 2) \cdot a_i, ..., in the town ((i + n - 2) \bmod n + 1) — n \cdot a_i minutes.You are given an array of b integer numbers, where b_i is the total duration of concerts in the i-th town. Reconstruct any correct sequence of positive integers a or say that it is impossible.
