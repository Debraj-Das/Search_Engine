Andrew plays a game called Civilization Dima helps himThe game has n cities and m bidirectional roads The cities are numbered from 1 to n Between any pair of cities there either is a single unique path or there is no path at all A path is such a sequence of distinct cities v1v2vk that there is a road between any contiguous cities vi and vi1 1ik The length of the described path equals to k1 We assume that two cities lie in the same region if and only if there is a path connecting these two citiesDuring the game events of two types take place  Andrew asks Dima about the length of the longest path in the region where city x lies  Andrew asks Dima to merge the region where city x lies with the region where city y lies If the cities lie in the same region then no merging is needed Otherwise you need to merge the regions as follows choose a city from the first region a city from the second region and connect them by a road so as to minimize the length of the longest path in the resulting region If there are multiple ways to do so you are allowed to choose any of them Dima finds it hard to execute Andrews queries so he asks you to help him Help Dima
