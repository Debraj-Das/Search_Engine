Polycarpus develops an interesting theory about the interrelation of arithmetic progressions with just everything in the world His current idea is that the population of the capital of Berland changes over time like an arithmetic progression Well or like multiple arithmetic progressionsPolycarpus believes that if he writes out the population of the capital for several consecutive years in the sequence a1a2an then it is convenient to consider the array as several arithmetic progressions written one after the other For example sequence 8642147102 can be considered as a sequence of three arithmetic progressions 8642 14710 and 2 which are written one after anotherUnfortunately Polycarpus may not have all the data for the n consecutive years a census of the population doesnt occur every year after all For this reason some values of ai may be unknown Such values are represented by number 1For a given sequence aa1a2an which consists of positive integers and values 1 find the minimum number of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get a To get a the progressions need to be written down one after the other Values 1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values ai0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressionsLet us remind you that a finite sequence c is called an arithmetic progression if the difference ci1ci of any two consecutive elements in it is constant By definition any sequence of length 1 is an arithmetic progression
