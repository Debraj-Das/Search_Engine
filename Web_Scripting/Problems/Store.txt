Natasha was already going to fly back to Earth when she remembered that she needs to go to the Martian store to buy Martian souvenirs for her friends.It is known, that the Martian year lasts x_{max} months, month lasts y_{max} days, day lasts z_{max} seconds. Natasha also knows that this store works according to the following schedule: 2 months in a year were selected: x_l and x_r (1\le x_l\le x_r\le x_{max}), 2 days in a month: y_l and y_r (1\le y_l\le y_r\le y_{max}) and 2 seconds in a day: z_l and z_r (1\le z_l\le z_r\le z_{max}). The store works at all such moments (month x, day y, second z), when simultaneously x_l\le x\le x_r, y_l\le y\le y_r and z_l\le z\le z_r.Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the numbers x_l,x_r,y_l,y_r,z_l,z_r.One Martian told Natasha: "I went to this store (n+m) times. n times of them it was opened, and m times — closed." He also described his every trip to the store: the month, day, second of the trip and whether the store was open or closed at that moment.Natasha can go to the store k times. For each of them, determine whether the store at the time of the trip is open, closed, or this information is unknown.
