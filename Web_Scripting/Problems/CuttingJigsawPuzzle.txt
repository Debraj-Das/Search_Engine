The Hedgehog recently remembered one of his favorite childhood activities  solving puzzles and got into it with new vigor He would sit day in day out with his friend buried into thousands of tiny pieces of the picture looking for the required items one by oneSoon the Hedgehog came up with a brilliant idea instead of buying readymade puzzles one can take his own large piece of paper with some picture and cut it into many small rectangular pieces then mix them and solve the resulting puzzle trying to piece together the picture The resulting task is even more challenging than the classic puzzle now all the fragments have the same rectangular shape and one can assemble the puzzle only relying on the picture drawn on the piecesAll puzzle pieces turn out to be of the same size XY because the picture is cut first by horizontal cuts with the pitch of X then with vertical cuts with the pitch of Y If we denote the initial size of the picture as AB then A must be divisible by X and B must be divisible by Y X and Y are integer numbers However not every such cutting of the picture will result in a good puzzle The Hedgehog finds a puzzle good if no two pieces in it are the same It is allowed to rotate the pieces when comparing them but it is forbidden to turn them over Your task is to count for a given picture the number of good puzzles that you can make from it and also to find the puzzle with the minimal piece size
