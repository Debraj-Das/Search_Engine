Lets define fx for a positive integer x as the length of the base10 representation of x without leading zeros I like to call it a digital logarithm Similar to a digital root if you are familiar with thatYou are given two arrays a and b each containing n positive integers In one operation you do the following   pick some integer i from 1 to n  assign either fai to ai or fbi to bi Two arrays are considered similar to each other if you can rearrange the elements in both of them so that they are equal eg ai  bi for all i from 1 to nWhats the smallest number of operations required to make a and b similar to each other
