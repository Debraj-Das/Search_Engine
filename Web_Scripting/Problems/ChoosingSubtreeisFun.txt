There is a tree consisting of n vertices The vertices are numbered from 1 to nLets define the length of an interval lr as the value rl1 The score of a subtree of this tree is the maximum length of such an interval lr that the vertices with numbers ll1r belong to the subtreeConsidering all subtrees of the tree whose size is at most k return the maximum score of the subtree Note that in this problem tree is not rooted so a subtree  is an arbitrary connected subgraph of the tree
