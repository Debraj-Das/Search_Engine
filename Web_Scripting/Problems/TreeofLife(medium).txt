Heidi got tired of deciphering the prophecy hidden in the Tree of Life and decided to go back to her headquarters rest a little and try there Of course she cannot uproot the Tree and take it with her so she made a drawing of the Tree on a piece of paper On second thought she made more identical drawings so as to have n in total where n is the number of vertices of the Tree of Life  who knows what might happenIndeed on her way back Heidi was ambushed by a group of zombies While she managed to fend them off they have damaged her drawings in a peculiar way from the ith copy the vertex numbered i was removed along with all adjacent edges In each picture the zombies have also erased all the vertex numbers and relabeled the remaining n1 vertices arbitrarily using numbers 1 to n fortunately each vertex still has a distinct number Whats more the drawings have been arbitrarily shuffledreorderedNow Heidi wants to recover the Tree of Life from her descriptions of all the drawings as lists of edges
