You are given a permutation p consisting of exactly 26 integers from 1 to 26 (since it is a permutation, each integer from 1 to 26 occurs in p exactly once) and two strings s and t consisting of lowercase Latin letters.A substring t' of string t is an occurence of string s if the following conditions are met:  |t'| = |s|;  for each i \in [1, |s|], either s_i = t'_i, or p_{idx(s_i)} = idx(t'_i), where idx(c) is the index of character c in Latin alphabet (idx(\text{a}) = 1, idx(\text{b}) = 2, idx(\text{z}) = 26). For example, if p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, p_3 = 1, s = \text{abc}, t = \text{abcaaba}, then three substrings of t are occurences of s (they are t' = \text{abc}, t' = \text{bca} and t' = \text{aba}).For each substring of t having length equal to |s|, check if it is an occurence of s.
