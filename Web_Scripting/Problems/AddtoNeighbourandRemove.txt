Polycarp was given an array of a[1 \dots n] of n integers. He can perform the following operation with the array a no more than n times:  Polycarp selects the index i and adds the value a_i to one of his choice of its neighbors. More formally, Polycarp adds the value of a_i to a_{i-1} or to a_{i+1} (if such a neighbor does not exist, then it is impossible to add to it).  After adding it, Polycarp removes the i-th element from the a array. During this step the length of a is decreased by 1. The two items above together denote one single operation.For example, if Polycarp has an array a = [3, 1, 6, 6, 2], then it can perform the following sequence of operations with it:   Polycarp selects i = 2 and adds the value a_i to (i-1)-th element: a = [4, 6, 6, 2].  Polycarp selects i = 1 and adds the value a_i to (i+1)-th element: a = [10, 6, 2].  Polycarp selects i = 3 and adds the value a_i to (i-1)-th element: a = [10, 8].  Polycarp selects i = 2 and adds the value a_i to (i-1)-th element: a = [18]. Note that Polycarp could stop performing operations at any time.Polycarp wondered how many minimum operations he would need to perform to make all the elements of a equal (i.e., he wants all a_i are equal to each other).
