Mitya has a rooted tree with n vertices indexed from 1 to n, where the root has index 1. Each vertex v initially had an integer number a_v \ge 0 written on it. For every vertex v Mitya has computed s_v: the sum of all values written on the vertices on the path from vertex v to the root, as well as h_v — the depth of vertex v, which denotes the number of vertices on the path from vertex v to the root. Clearly, s_1=a_1 and h_1=1.Then Mitya erased all numbers a_v, and by accident he also erased all values s_v for vertices with even depth (vertices with even h_v). Your task is to restore the values a_v for every vertex, or determine that Mitya made a mistake. In case there are multiple ways to restore the values, you're required to find one which minimizes the total sum of values a_v for all vertices in the tree.
