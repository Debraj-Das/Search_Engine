This is an easier version of the problem with smaller constraints.Korney Korneevich dag up an array a of length n. Korney Korneevich has recently read about the operation bitwise XOR, so he wished to experiment with it. For this purpose, he decided to find all integers x \ge 0 such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array a, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to x.It didn't take a long time for Korney Korneevich to find all such x, and he wants to check his result. That's why he asked you to solve this problem!A sequence s is a subsequence of a sequence b if s can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.A sequence s_1, s_2, \ldots , s_m is called increasing if s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_m.
