You are given an array a of length n that has a special condition: every element in this array has at most 7 divisors. Find the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of this array product of whose elements is a perfect square.A sequence a is a subsequence of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
