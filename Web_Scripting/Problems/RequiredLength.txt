You may perform several operations with the integer x.Each operation you perform is the following one: choose any digit y that occurs in the decimal representation of x at least once, and replace x by x \cdot y.You want to make the length of decimal representation of x (without leading zeroes) equal to n. What is the minimum number of operations required to do that?
