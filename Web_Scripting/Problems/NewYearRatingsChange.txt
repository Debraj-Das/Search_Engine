We know that user i wants to get at least ai rating units as a present.The X site is administered by very creative and thrifty people. On the one hand, they want to give distinct ratings and on the other hand, the total sum of the ratings in the present must be as small as possible.Help site X cope with the challenging task of rating distribution.
