Ksenia has an array a consisting of n positive integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. In one operation she can do the following:   choose three distinct indices i, j, k, and then  change all of a_i, a_j, a_k to a_i \oplus a_j \oplus a_k simultaneously, where \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation. She wants to make all a_i equal in at most n operations, or to determine that it is impossible to do so. She wouldn't ask for your help, but please, help her!
