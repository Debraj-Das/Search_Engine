A string s of length n can be encrypted by the following algorithm:  iterate over all divisors of n in decreasing order (i.e. from n to 1),  for each divisor d, reverse the substring s[1 \dots d] (i.e. the substring which starts at position 1 and ends at position d). For example, the above algorithm applied to the string s="codeforces" leads to the following changes: "codeforces" \to "secrofedoc" \to "orcesfedoc" \to "rocesfedoc" \to "rocesfedoc" (obviously, the last reverse operation doesn't change the string because d=1).You are given the encrypted string t. Your task is to decrypt this string, i.e., to find a string s such that the above algorithm results in string t. It can be proven that this string s always exists and is unique.
