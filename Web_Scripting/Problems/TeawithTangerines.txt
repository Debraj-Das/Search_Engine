There are n pieces of tangerine peel, the i-th of them has size a_i. In one step it is possible to divide one piece of size x into two pieces of positive integer sizes y and z so that y + z = x.You want that for each pair of pieces, their sizes differ strictly less than twice. In other words, there should not be two pieces of size x and y, such that 2x \le y. What is the minimum possible number of steps needed to satisfy the condition?
