You are given an array a consisting of n integers.In one move, you can choose two indices 1 \le i, j \le n such that i \ne j and set a_i := a_j. You can perform such moves any number of times (possibly, zero). You can choose different indices in different operations. The operation := is the operation of assignment (i.e. you choose i and j and replace a_i with a_j).Your task is to say if it is possible to obtain an array with an odd (not divisible by 2) sum of elements.You have to answer t independent test cases.
