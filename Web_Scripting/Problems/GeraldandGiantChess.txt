Giant chess is quite common in Geraldion We will not delve into the rules of the game well just say that the game takes place on an hw field and it is painted in two colors but not like in chess Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard Gerald has almost won and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board where it is now standing to the lower right corner Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested in how many ways can he winThe pawn which Gerald has got left can go in two ways one cell down or one cell to the right In addition it can not go to the black cells otherwise the Gerald still loses There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field so that according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over and Pollard is just watching this process
