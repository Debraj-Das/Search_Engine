A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "(" and ")". A regular bracket sequence (or, shortly, an RBS) is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example:  bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)");  bracket sequences ")(", "(" and ")" are not. Let's denote the concatenation of two strings x and y as x+y. For example, "()()" + ")(" = "()())(".You are given n bracket sequences s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n. You can rearrange them in any order (you can rearrange only the strings themselves, but not the characters in them).Your task is to rearrange the strings in such a way that the string s_1 + s_2 + \dots + s_n has as many non-empty prefixes that are RBS as possible.
