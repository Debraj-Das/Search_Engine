You are given two permutations a and b both of size n A permutation of size n is an array of n elements where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once The elements in each permutation are indexed from 1 to nYou can perform the following operation any number of times  choose an integer i from 1 to n  let x be the integer such that ax  i Swap ai with ax  let y be the integer such that by  i Swap bi with by Your goal is to make both permutations sorted in ascending order ie the conditions a1  a2  dots  an and b1  b2  dots  bn must be satisfied using minimum number of operations Note that both permutations must be sorted after you perform the sequence of operations you have chosen
