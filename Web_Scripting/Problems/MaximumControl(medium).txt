The Resistance is trying to take control over as many planets of a particular solar system as possible Princess Heidi is in charge of the fleet and she must send ships to some planets in order to maximize the number of controlled planetsThe Galaxy contains N planets connected by bidirectional hyperspace tunnels in such a way that there is a unique path between every pair of the planetsA planet is controlled by the Resistance if there is a Resistance ship in its orbit or if the planet lies on the shortest path between some two planets that have Resistance ships in their orbitsHeidi has not yet made up her mind as to how many ships to use Therefore she is asking you to compute for every K123N the maximum number of planets that can be controlled with a fleet consisting of K ships
