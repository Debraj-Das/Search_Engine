There are n football teams in the world. The Main Football Organization (MFO) wants to host at most m games. MFO wants the i-th game to be played between the teams a_i and b_i in one of the k stadiums. Let s_{ij} be the numbers of games the i-th team played in the j-th stadium. MFO does not want a team to have much more games in one stadium than in the others. Therefore, for each team i, the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum among s_{i1}, s_{i2}, \ldots, s_{ik} should not exceed 2.Each team has w_i — the amount of money MFO will earn for each game of the i-th team. If the i-th team plays l games, MFO will earn w_i \cdot l.MFO needs to find what games in what stadiums they need to host in order to earn as much money as possible, not violating the rule they set.However, this problem is too complicated for MFO. Therefore, they are asking you to help them.
