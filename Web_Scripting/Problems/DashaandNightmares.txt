Dasha, an excellent student, is studying at the best mathematical lyceum in the country. Recently, a mysterious stranger brought n words consisting of small latin letters s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n to the lyceum. Since that day, Dasha has been tormented by nightmares.Consider some pair of integers \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i \le j \le n). A nightmare is a string for which it is true:  It is obtained by concatenation s_{i}s_{j};  Its length is odd;  The number of different letters in it is exactly 25;  The number of occurrences of each letter that is in the word is odd. For example, if s_i= "abcdefg" and s_j= "ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", the pair \langle i, j \rangle creates a nightmare.Dasha will stop having nightmares if she counts their number. There are too many nightmares, so Dasha needs your help. Count the number of different nightmares.Nightmares are called different if the corresponding pairs \langle i, j \rangle are different. The pairs \langle i_1, j_1 \rangle and \langle i_2, j_2 \rangle are called different if i_1 \neq i_2 or j_1 \neq j_2.
