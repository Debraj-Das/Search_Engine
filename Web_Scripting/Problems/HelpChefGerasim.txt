In a far away kingdom young pages help to set the table for the King. As they are terribly mischievous, one needs to keep an eye on the control whether they have set everything correctly. This time the royal chef Gerasim had the impression that the pages have played a prank again: they had poured the juice from one cup to another. Now Gerasim wants to check his hypothesis. The good thing is that chef Gerasim always pour the same number of milliliters of juice to all cups in the royal kitchen. Having thoroughly measured the juice in each cup, Gerasim asked you to write a program that will determine from which cup juice was poured to which one; otherwise, the program should determine that this time the pages set the table diligently.To simplify your task we shall consider the cups to be bottomless so that the juice never overfills a cup and pours out, however much it can be. Besides, by some strange reason in a far away kingdom one can only pour to a cup or from one cup to another an integer number of milliliters of juice.
