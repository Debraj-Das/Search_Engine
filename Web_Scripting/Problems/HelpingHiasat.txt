Hiasat registered a new account in NeckoForces and when his friends found out about that, each one of them asked to use his name as Hiasat's handle.Luckily for Hiasat, he can change his handle in some points in time. Also he knows the exact moments friends will visit his profile page. Formally, you are given a sequence of events of two types:  1 — Hiasat can change his handle.  2 s — friend s visits Hiasat's profile. The friend s will be happy, if each time he visits Hiasat's profile his handle would be s.Hiasat asks you to help him, find the maximum possible number of happy friends he can get.
