Little Petya was given this problem for homeworkYou are given function  here  represents the operation of taking the remainder His task is to count the number of integers x in range ab with property fxxIt is a pity that Petya forgot the order in which the remainders should be taken and wrote down only 4 numbers Each of 24 possible orders of taking the remainder has equal probability of being chosen For example if Petya has numbers 1 2 3 4 then he can take remainders in that order or first take remainder modulo 4 then modulo 2 3 1 There also are 22 other permutations of these numbers that represent orders in which remainder can be taken In this problem 4 numbers wrote down by Petya will be pairwise distinctNow it is impossible for Petya to complete the task given by teacher but just for fun he decided to find the number of integers  with property that probability that fxx is not less than 314159265352718281828459045 In other words Petya will pick up the number x if there exist at least 7 permutations of numbers p1p2p3p4 for which fxx
