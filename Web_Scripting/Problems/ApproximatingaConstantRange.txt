When Xellos was doing a practice course in university he once had to measure the intensity of an effect that slowly approached equilibrium A good way to determine the equilibrium intensity would be choosing a sufficiently large number of consecutive data points that seems as constant as possible and taking their average Of course with the usual sizes of data its nothing challenging but why not make a similar programming contest problem while were at itYoure given a sequence of n data points a1an There arent any big jumps between consecutive data points for each 1in its guaranteed that ai1ai1A range lr of data points is said to be almost constant if the difference between the largest and the smallest value in that range is at most 1 Formally let M be the maximum and m the minimum value of ai for lir the range lr is almost constant if Mm1Find the length of the longest almost constant range
