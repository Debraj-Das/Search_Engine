  William has a favorite bracket sequence. Since his favorite sequence is quite big he provided it to you as a sequence of positive integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n where c_i is the number of consecutive brackets "(" if i is an odd number or the number of consecutive brackets ")" if i is an even number.For example for a bracket sequence "((())()))" a corresponding sequence of numbers is [3, 2, 1, 3].You need to find the total number of continuous subsequences (subsegments) [l, r] (l \le r) of the original bracket sequence, which are regular bracket sequences.A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "+" and "1" into this sequence. For example, sequences "(())()", "()" and "(()(()))" are regular, while ")(", "(()" and "(()))(" are not.
