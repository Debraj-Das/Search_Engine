There are four stones on an infinite line in integer coordinates a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4. The goal is to have the stones in coordinates b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4. The order of the stones does not matter, that is, a stone from any position a_i can end up in at any position b_j, provided there is a required number of stones in each position (that is, if a coordinate x appears k times among numbers b_1, \ldots, b_4, there should be exactly k stones at x in the end).We are allowed to move stones with the following operation: choose two stones at distinct positions x and y with at least one stone each, and move one stone from x to 2y - x. In other words, the operation moves a stone to a symmetric position relative to some other stone. At any moment it is allowed to have any number of stones at the same position.Find any sequence of operations that achieves the goal, or determine that it is impossible. The sequence does not have to be shortest, but it may contain at most 1000 operations.
