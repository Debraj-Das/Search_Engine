You are given n of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n. Process q queries of two types: query of the form "0 x_j": add the value x_j to all even elements of the array a, query of the form "1 x_j": add the value x_j to all odd elements of the array a.Note that when processing the query, we look specifically at the odd/even value of a_i, not its index.After processing each query, print the sum of the elements of the array a.Please note that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).
