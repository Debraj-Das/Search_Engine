Yesterday was a fair in a supermarket's grocery section. There were n jars with spices on the fair. Before the event the jars were numbered from 1 to n from the left to the right. After the event the jars were moved and the grocer had to sort them by the increasing of the numbers.The grocer has a special machine at his disposal. The machine can take any 5 or less jars and rearrange them in the way the grocer wants. Note that the jars do not have to stand consecutively. For example, from the permutation 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1 one can get permutation 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, if pick the jars on the positions 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. Which minimum number of such operations is needed to arrange all the jars in the order of their numbers' increasing?
