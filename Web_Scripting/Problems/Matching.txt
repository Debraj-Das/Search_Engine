An integer template is a string consisting of digits and/or question marks.A positive (strictly greater than 0) integer matches the integer template if it is possible to replace every question mark in the template with a digit in such a way that we get the decimal representation of that integer without any leading zeroes.For example:  42 matches 4?;  1337 matches ????;  1337 matches 1?3?;  1337 matches 1337;  3 does not match ??;  8 does not match ???8;  1337 does not match 1?7. You are given an integer template consisting of at most 5 characters. Calculate the number of positive (strictly greater than 0) integers that match it.
