It's the year 5555. You have a graph, and you want to find a long cycle and a huge independent set, just because you can. But for now, let's just stick with finding either.Given a connected graph with n vertices, you can choose to either:  find an independent set that has exactly \lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil vertices. find a simple cycle of length at least \lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil. An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. I have a proof you can always solve one of these problems, but it's too long to fit this margin.
