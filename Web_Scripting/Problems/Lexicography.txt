Lucy likes letters. She studied the definition of the lexicographical order at school and plays with it.At first, she tried to construct the lexicographically smallest word out of given letters. It was so easy! Then she tried to build multiple words and minimize one of them. This was much harder!Formally, Lucy wants to make n words of length l each out of the given n \cdot l letters, so that the k-th of them in the lexicographic order is lexicographically as small as possible.
