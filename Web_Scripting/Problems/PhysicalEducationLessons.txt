This year Alex has finished school and now he is a firstyear student of Berland State University For him it was a total surprise that even though he studies programming he still has to attend physical education lessons The end of the term is very soon but unfortunately Alex still hasnt attended a single lessonSince Alex doesnt want to get expelled he wants to know the number of working days left until the end of the term so he can attend physical education lessons during these days But in BSU calculating the number of working days is a complicated matterThere are n days left before the end of the term numbered from 1 to n and initially all of them are working days Then the university staff sequentially publishes q orders one after another Each order is characterised by three numbers l r and k  If k1 then all days from l to r inclusive become nonworking days If some of these days are made working days by some previous order then these days still become nonworking days  If k2 then all days from l to r inclusive become working days If some of these days are made nonworking days by some previous order then these days still become working days Help Alex to determine the number of working days left after each order
