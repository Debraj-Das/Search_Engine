Polycarp has guessed three positive integers a, b and c. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order — their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order: a+b, a+c, b+c and a+b+c.You have to guess three numbers a, b and c using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.Pay attention that some given numbers a, b and c can be equal (it is also possible that a=b=c).
