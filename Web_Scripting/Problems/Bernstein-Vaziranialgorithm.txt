You are given a quantum oracle  an operation on N1 qubits which implements a function  You are guaranteed that the function f implemented by the oracle is scalar product function oracle from problem D1 Here  an array of N integers each of which can be 0 or 1 Your task is to reconstruct the array  Your code is allowed to call the given oracle only onceYou have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs an integer N  the number of qubits in the oracle input 1N8 an oracle Uf implemented as an operation with signature Qubit Qubit   ie an operation which takes as input an array of qubits and an output qubit and has no outputThe return of your operation is an array of integers of length N each of them 0 or 1Your code should have the following signaturenamespace Solution     open MicrosoftQuantumPrimitive    open MicrosoftQuantumCanon    operation Solve N  Int Uf  Qubit Qubit    Int            body                     your code here
