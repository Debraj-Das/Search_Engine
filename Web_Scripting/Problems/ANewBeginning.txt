Annie has gotten bored of winning every coding contest and farming unlimited rating. Today, she is going to farm potatoes instead.Annie's garden is an infinite 2D plane. She has n potatoes to plant, and the i-th potato must be planted at (x_i,y_i). Starting at the point (0, 0), Annie begins walking, in one step she can travel one unit right or up (increasing her x or y coordinate by 1 respectively). At any point (X,Y) during her walk she can plant some potatoes at arbitrary points using her potato gun, consuming \max(|X-x|,|Y-y|) units of energy in order to plant a potato at (x,y). Find the minimum total energy required to plant every potato.Note that Annie may plant any number of potatoes from any point.
