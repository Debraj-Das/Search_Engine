Little Timofey likes integers a lot Unfortunately he is very young and cant work with very big integers so he does all the operations modulo his favorite prime m Also Timofey likes to look for arithmetical progressions everywhereOne of his birthday presents was a sequence of distinct integers a1a2an Timofey wants to know whether he can rearrange the elements of the sequence so that is will be an arithmetical progression modulo m or notArithmetical progression modulo m of length n with first element x and difference d is sequence of integers xxdx2dxn1d each taken modulo m
