You are given a directed acyclic graph with n vertices and m edges. There are no self-loops or multiple edges between any pair of vertices. Graph can be disconnected.You should assign labels to all vertices in such a way that:  Labels form a valid permutation of length n — an integer sequence such that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once in it.  If there exists an edge from vertex v to vertex u then labelv should be smaller than labelu.  Permutation should be lexicographically smallest among all suitable. Find such sequence of labels to satisfy all the conditions.
