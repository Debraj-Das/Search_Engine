You are given a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. Each cell of this grid should be colored either black or white.Two cells are considered neighbours if they have a common border and share the same color. Two cells A and B belong to the same component if they are neighbours, or if there is a neighbour of A that belongs to the same component with B.Let's call some bicoloring beautiful if it has exactly k components.Count the number of beautiful bicolorings. The number can be big enough, so print the answer modulo 998244353.
