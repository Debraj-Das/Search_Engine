You are given a binary string s (recall that a string is binary if each character is either 0 or 1).Let f(t) be the decimal representation of integer t written in binary form (possibly with leading zeroes). For example f(011) = 3, f(00101) = 5, f(00001) = 1, f(10) = 2, f(000) = 0 and f(000100) = 4.The substring s_{l}, s_{l+1}, \dots , s_{r} is good if r - l + 1 = f(s_l \dots s_r).For example string s = 1011 has 5 good substrings: s_1 \dots s_1 = 1, s_3 \dots s_3 = 1, s_4 \dots s_4 = 1, s_1 \dots s_2 = 10 and s_2 \dots s_4 = 011. Your task is to calculate the number of good substrings of string s.You have to answer t independent queries.
