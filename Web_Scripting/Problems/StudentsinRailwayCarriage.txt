There are n consecutive seat places in a railway carriage. Each place is either empty or occupied by a passenger.The university team for the Olympiad consists of a student-programmers and b student-athletes. Determine the largest number of students from all a+b students, which you can put in the railway carriage so that:  no student-programmer is sitting next to the student-programmer;  and no student-athlete is sitting next to the student-athlete. In the other words, there should not be two consecutive (adjacent) places where two student-athletes or two student-programmers are sitting.Consider that initially occupied seat places are occupied by jury members (who obviously are not students at all).
