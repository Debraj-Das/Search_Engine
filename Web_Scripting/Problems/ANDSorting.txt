You are given a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1 (each of them occurs exactly once). Initially, the permutation is not sorted (that is, p_i>p_{i+1} for at least one 1 \le i \le n - 1). The permutation is called X-sortable for some non-negative integer X if it is possible to sort the permutation by performing the operation below some finite number of times:   Choose two indices i and j (1 \le i \lt j \le n) such that p_i \& p_j = X.  Swap p_i and p_j. Here \& denotes the bitwise AND operation.Find the maximum value of X such that p is X-sortable. It can be shown that there always exists some value of X such that p is X-sortable.
