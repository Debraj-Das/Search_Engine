For example, string "abaca" contains ugly pairs at positions (1, 2) — "ab" and (2, 3) — "ba". Letters 'a' and 'z' aren't considered neighbouring in a alphabet.Can you rearrange the letters of a given string so that there are no ugly pairs? You can choose any order of the letters of the given string but you can't add any new letters or remove the existing ones.
