Fox Ciel saw a large field while she was on a bus The field was a nm rectangle divided into 11 cells Some cells were wasteland and other each cell contained crop plants either carrots or kiwis or grapes After seeing the field carefully Ciel found that the crop plants of each cell were planted in following procedure  Assume that the rows are numbered 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns are numbered 1 to m from left to right and a cell in row i and column j is represented as ij  First each field is either cultivated or waste Crop plants will be planted in the cultivated cells in the order of 111m212mn1nm Waste cells will be ignored  Crop plants either carrots or kiwis or grapes will be planted in each cell one after another cyclically Carrots will be planted in the first cell then kiwis in the second one grapes in the third one carrots in the forth one kiwis in the fifth one and so on The following figure will show you the example of this procedure Here a white square represents a cultivated cell and a black square represents a waste cell  Now she is wondering how to determine the crop plants in some certain cells
