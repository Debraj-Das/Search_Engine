Monocarp had an array a consisting of n integers. He has decided to choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n, and then sort the subarray a[l..r] (the subarray a[l..r] is the part of the array a containing the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, a_{l+2}, \dots, a_{r-1}, a_r) in non-descending order. After sorting the subarray, Monocarp has obtained a new array, which we denote as a'.For example, if a = [6, 7, 3, 4, 4, 6, 5], and Monocarp has chosen l = 2, r = 5, then a' = [6, 3, 4, 4, 7, 6, 5].You are given the arrays a and a'. Find the integers l and r that Monocarp could have chosen. If there are multiple pairs of values (l, r), find the one which corresponds to the longest subarray.
