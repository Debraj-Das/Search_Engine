Petya loves computer games Finally a game that hes been waiting for so long came outThe main character of this game has n different skills each of which is characterized by an integer ai from 0 to 100 The higher the number ai is the higher is the ith skill of the character The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values of  for all i from 1 to n The expression  x denotes the result of rounding the number x down to the nearest integerAt the beginning of the game Petya got k improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petyas character by exactly one For example if a446 after using one imporvement unit to this skill it becomes equal to 47 A heros skill cannot rise higher more than 100 Thus it is permissible that some of the units will remain unusedYour task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character It is not necessary to use all the improvement units
