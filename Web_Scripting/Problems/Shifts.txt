You are given a table consisting of n rows and m columns. Each cell of the table contains a number, 0 or 1. In one move we can choose some row of the table and cyclically shift its values either one cell to the left, or one cell to the right.To cyclically shift a table row one cell to the right means to move the value of each cell, except for the last one, to the right neighboring cell, and to move the value of the last cell to the first cell. A cyclical shift of a row to the left is performed similarly, but in the other direction. For example, if we cyclically shift a row "00110" one cell to the right, we get a row "00011", but if we shift a row "00110" one cell to the left, we get a row "01100".Determine the minimum number of moves needed to make some table column consist only of numbers 1.
