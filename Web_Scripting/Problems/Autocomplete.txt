Autocomplete is a program function that enables inputting the text (in editors, command line shells, browsers etc.) completing the text by its inputted part. Vasya is busy working on a new browser called 'BERowser'. He happens to be working on the autocomplete function in the address line at this very moment. A list consisting of n last visited by the user pages and the inputted part s are known. Your task is to complete s to make it an address of one of the pages from the list. You have to find the lexicographically smallest address having a prefix s.
