You are given a bracket sequence s consisting of n opening '(' and closing ')' brackets.A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()", "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)", "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(" and "(" are not.You can change the type of some bracket s_i. It means that if s_i =  ')' then you can change it to '(' and vice versa.Your task is to calculate the number of positions i such that if you change the type of the i-th bracket, then the resulting bracket sequence becomes regular.
