Kuro is living in a country called Uberland, consisting of n towns, numbered from 1 to n, and n - 1 bidirectional roads connecting these towns. It is possible to reach each town from any other. Each road connects two towns a and b. Kuro loves walking and he is planning to take a walking marathon, in which he will choose a pair of towns (u, v) (u \neq v) and walk from u using the shortest path to v (note that (u, v) is considered to be different from (v, u)).Oddly, there are 2 special towns in Uberland named Flowrisa (denoted with the index x) and Beetopia (denoted with the index y). Flowrisa is a town where there are many strong-scent flowers, and Beetopia is another town where many bees live. In particular, Kuro will avoid any pair of towns (u, v) if on the path from u to v, he reaches Beetopia after he reached Flowrisa, since the bees will be attracted with the flower smell on Kuro’s body and sting him.Kuro wants to know how many pair of city (u, v) he can take as his route. Since he’s not really bright, he asked you to help him with this problem.
