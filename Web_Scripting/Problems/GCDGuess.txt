This is an interactive problem.There is a positive integer 1 \le x \le 10^9 that you have to guess.In one query you can choose two positive integers a \neq b. As an answer to this query you will get \gcd(x + a, x + b), where \gcd(n, m) is the greatest common divisor of the numbers n and m.To guess one hidden number x you are allowed to make no more than 30 queries.
