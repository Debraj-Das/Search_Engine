Nezzar has n balls, numbered with integers 1, 2, \ldots, n. Numbers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n are written on them, respectively. Numbers on those balls form a non-decreasing sequence, which means that a_i \leq a_{i+1} for all 1 \leq i < n.Nezzar wants to color the balls using the minimum number of colors, such that the following holds.  For any color, numbers on balls will form a strictly increasing sequence if he keeps balls with this chosen color and discards all other balls.  Note that a sequence with the length at most 1 is considered as a strictly increasing sequence.Please help Nezzar determine the minimum number of colors.
