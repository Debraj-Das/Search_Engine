Timur loves codeforces. That's why he has a string s having length 10 made containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices string s differs from the string "codeforces".For example string s = "coolforsez" differs from "codeforces" in 4 indices, shown in bold.Help Timur by finding the number of indices where string s differs from "codeforces".Note that you can't reorder the characters in the string s.
