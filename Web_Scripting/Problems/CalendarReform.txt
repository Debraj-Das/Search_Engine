Reforms have started in Berland again At this time the Parliament is discussing the reform of the calendar To make the lives of citizens of Berland more varied it was decided to change the calendar As more and more people are complaining that the years fly by it was decided that starting from the next year the number of days per year will begin to grow So the coming year will have exactly a days the next after coming year will have a1 days the next one will have a2 days and so on This schedule is planned for the coming n years in the nth year the length of the year will be equal an1 dayNo one has yet decided what will become of months An MP Palevny made the following proposal   The calendar for each month is comfortable to be printed on a square sheet of paper We are proposed to make the number of days in each month be the square of some integer The number of days per month should be the same for each month of any year but may be different for different years  The number of days in each year must be divisible by the number of days per month in this year This rule ensures that the number of months in each year is an integer  The number of days per month for each year must be chosen so as to save the maximum amount of paper to print the calendars In other words the number of days per month should be as much as possible These rules provide an unambiguous method for choosing the number of days in each month for any given year length For example according to Palevnys proposition a year that consists of 108 days will have three months 36 days each The year that consists of 99 days will have 11 months 9 days each and a year of 365 days will have 365 months one day eachThe proposal provoked heated discussion in the community the famous mathematician Perelmanov quickly calculated that if the proposal is supported then in a period of n years beginning with the year that has a days the country will spend p sheets of paper to print a set of calendars for these years Perelmanovs calculations take into account the fact that the set will contain one calendar for each year and each month will be printed on a separate sheetRepeat Perelmanovs achievement and print the required number p You are given positive integers a and n Perelmanov warns you that your program should not work longer than four seconds at the maximum test
