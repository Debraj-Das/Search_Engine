For months Maxim has been coming to work on his favorite bicycle And quite recently he decided that he is ready to take part in a cyclists competitionsHe knows that this year n competitions will take place During the ith competition the participant must as quickly as possible complete a ride along a straight line from point si to point fi sifiMeasuring time is a complex process related to usage of a special sensor and a time counter Think of the front wheel of a bicycle as a circle of radius r Lets neglect the thickness of a tire the size of the sensor and all physical effects The sensor is placed on the rim of the wheel that is on some fixed point on a circle of radius r After that the counter moves just like the chosen point of the circle ie moves forward and rotates around the center of the circleAt the beginning each participant can choose any point bi such that his bike is fully behind the starting line that is bisir After that he starts the movement instantly accelerates to his maximum speed and at time tsi when the coordinate of the sensor is equal to the coordinate of the start the time counter starts The cyclist makes a complete ride moving with his maximum speed and at the moment the sensors coordinate is equal to the coordinate of the finish moment of time tfi the time counter deactivates and records the final time Thus the counter records that the participant made a complete ride in time tfitsi  Maxim is good at math and he suspects that the total result doesnt only depend on his maximum speed v but also on his choice of the initial point bi Now Maxim is asking you to calculate for each of n competitions the minimum possible time that can be measured by the time counter The radius of the wheel of his bike is equal to r
