In this problem you will write a simple generator of Brainfuck (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) calculators.You are given an arithmetic expression consisting of integers from 0 to 255 and addition/subtraction signs between them. Output a Brainfuck program which, when executed, will print the result of evaluating this expression.We use a fairly standard Brainfuck interpreter for checking the programs: 30000 memory cells. memory cells store integers from 0 to 255 with unsigned 8-bit wraparound. console input (, command) is not supported, but it's not needed for this problem.
