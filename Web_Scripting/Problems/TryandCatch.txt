Vasya is developing his own programming language VPL (Vasya Programming Language). Right now he is busy making the system of exceptions. He thinks that the system of exceptions must function like that.The exceptions are processed by try-catch-blocks. There are two operators that work with the blocks: The try operator. It opens a new try-catch-block.  The catch(<exception_type>, <message>) operator. It closes the try-catch-block that was started last and haven't yet been closed. This block can be activated only via exception of type <exception_type>. When we activate this block, the screen displays the <message>. If at the given moment there is no open try-catch-block, then we can't use the catch operator.The exceptions can occur in the program in only one case: when we use the throw operator. The throw(<exception_type>) operator creates the exception of the given type.Let's suggest that as a result of using some throw operator the program created an exception of type a. In this case a try-catch-block is activated, such that this block's try operator was described in the program earlier than the used throw operator. Also, this block's catch operator was given an exception type a as a parameter and this block's catch operator is described later that the used throw operator. If there are several such try-catch-blocks, then the system activates the block whose catch operator occurs earlier than others. If no try-catch-block was activated, then the screen displays message "Unhandled Exception".To test the system, Vasya wrote a program that contains only try, catch and throw operators, one line contains no more than one operator, the whole program contains exactly one throw operator.Your task is: given a program in VPL, determine, what message will be displayed on the screen.
