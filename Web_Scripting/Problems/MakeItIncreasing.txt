You are given an array of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and a set b of k distinct integers from 1 to n.In one operation, you may choose two integers i and x (1 \le i \le n, x can be any integer) and assign a_i := x. This operation can be done only if i does not belong to the set b.Calculate the minimum number of operations you should perform so the array a is increasing (that is, a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \dots < a_n), or report that it is impossible.
