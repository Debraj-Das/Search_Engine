The final match of the Berland Football Cup has been held recently. The referee has shown n yellow cards throughout the match. At the beginning of the match there were a_1 players in the first team and a_2 players in the second team.The rules of sending players off the game are a bit different in Berland football. If a player from the first team receives k_1 yellow cards throughout the match, he can no longer participate in the match — he's sent off. And if a player from the second team receives k_2 yellow cards, he's sent off. After a player leaves the match, he can no longer receive any yellow cards. Each of n yellow cards was shown to exactly one player. Even if all players from one team (or even from both teams) leave the match, the game still continues.The referee has lost his records on who has received each yellow card. Help him to determine the minimum and the maximum number of players that could have been thrown out of the game.
