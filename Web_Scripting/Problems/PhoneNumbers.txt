And where the are the phone numbersYou are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer k Find the lexicographically smallest string t of length k such that its set of letters is a subset of the set of letters of s and s is lexicographically smaller than tIts guaranteed that the answer existsNote that the set of letters is a set not a multiset For example the set of letters of abadaba is abdString p is lexicographically smaller than string q if p is a prefix of q is not equal to q or there exists i such that piqi and for all ji it is satisfied that pjqj For example abc is lexicographically smaller than abcd  abd is lexicographically smaller than abec afa is not lexicographically smaller than ab and a is not lexicographically smaller than a
