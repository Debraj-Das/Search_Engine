Andrews favourite Krakozyabra has recenly fled away and now hes eager to bring it backAt the moment the refugee is inside an icy cave with n icicles dangling from the ceiling located in integer coordinates numbered from 1 to n The distance between floor and the ith icicle is equal to aiAndrew is free to choose an arbitrary integer point T in range from 1 to n inclusive and at time instant 0 launch a sound wave spreading into both sides left and right at the speed of one point per second Any icicle touched by the wave starts falling at the same speed that means that in a second the distance from floor to icicle decreases by one but cannot become less that zero While distance from icicle to floor is more than zero it is considered passable as soon as it becomes zero the icicle blocks the path and prohibits passingKrakozyabra is initially ie at time instant 0 is located at point  and starts running in the right direction at the speed of one point per second You can assume that events in a single second happen in the following order first Krakozyabra changes its position and only then the sound spreads and icicles fall in particular that means that if Krakozyabra is currently at point  and the falling ie already touched by the sound wave icicle at point i is 1 point from the floor then Krakozyabra will pass it and find itself at  and only after that the icicle will finally fall and block the pathKrakozyabra is considered entrapped if there are fallen ie with ai0 icicles both to the left and to the right of its current position Help Andrew find the minimum possible time it takes to entrap Krakozyabra by choosing the optimal value of T or report that this mission is impossible
