Valera conducts experiments with algorithms that search for shortest paths He has recently studied the Floyds algorithm so its time to work with itValeras already written the code that counts the shortest distance between any pair of vertexes in a nondirected connected graph from n vertexes and m edges containing no loops and multiple edges Besides Valeras decided to mark part of the vertexes Hes marked exactly k vertexes a1a2akValeras code is given belowansij  the shortest distance for a pair of vertexes ijai   vertexes marked by Valerafori  1 i  n i     forj  1 j  n j         if i  j            ansij  0        else            ansij  INF  INF is a very large number         fori  1 i  m i     read a pair of vertexes u v that have a nondirected edge between them    ansuv  1    ansvu  1for i  1 i  k i     v  ai    forj  1 j  n j        forr  1 r  n r            ansjr  minansjr ansjv  ansvrValera has seen that his code is wrong Help the boy Given the set of marked vertexes a1a2ak find such nondirected connected graph consisting of n vertexes and m edges for which Valeras code counts the wrong shortest distance for at least one pair of vertexes ij Valera is really keen to get a graph without any loops and multiple edges If no such graph exists print 1
