There was a string s which was supposed to be encrypted. For this reason, all 26 lowercase English letters were arranged in a circle in some order, afterwards, each letter in s was replaced with the one that follows in clockwise order, in that way the string t was obtained. You are given a string t. Determine the lexicographically smallest string s that could be a prototype of the given string t.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b of the same length if and only if:   in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter, that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
