This is a hard version of the problem. The actual problems are different, but the easy version is almost a subtask of the hard version. Note that the constraints and the output format are different.You are given a string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.You have to color all its characters the minimum number of colors (each character to exactly one color, the same letters can be colored the same or different colors, i.e. you can choose exactly one color for each index in s).After coloring, you can swap any two neighboring characters of the string that are colored different colors. You can perform such an operation arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times.The goal is to make the string sorted, i.e. all characters should be in alphabetical order.Your task is to find the minimum number of colors which you have to color the given string in so that after coloring it can become sorted by some sequence of swaps. Note that you have to restore only coloring, not the sequence of swaps.
