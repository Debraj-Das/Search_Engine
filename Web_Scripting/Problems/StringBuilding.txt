You are given a string s. You have to determine whether it is possible to build the string s out of strings aa, aaa, bb and/or bbb by concatenating them. You can use the strings aa, aaa, bb and/or bbb any number of times and in any order.For example:  aaaabbb can be built as aa + aa + bbb;  bbaaaaabbb can be built as bb + aaa + aa + bbb;  aaaaaa can be built as aa + aa + aa;  abab cannot be built from aa, aaa, bb and/or bbb.
