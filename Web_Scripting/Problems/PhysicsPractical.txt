One day Vasya was on a physics practical performing the task on measuring the capacitance He followed the teachers advice and did as much as n measurements and recorded the results in the notebook After that he was about to show the results to the teacher but he remembered that at the last lesson the teacher had made his friend Petya redo the experiment because the largest and the smallest results differed by more than two times Vasya is lazy and he does not want to redo the experiment He wants to do the task and go home play computer games So he decided to cheat before Vasya shows the measurements to the teacher he will erase some of them so as to make the largest and the smallest results of the remaining measurements differ in no more than two times In other words if the remaining measurements have the smallest result x and the largest result y then the inequality y2x must fulfill Of course to avoid the teachers suspicion Vasya wants to remove as few measurement results as possible from his notesHelp Vasya find what minimum number of measurement results he will have to erase from his notes so that the largest and the smallest of the remaining results of the measurements differed in no more than two times
