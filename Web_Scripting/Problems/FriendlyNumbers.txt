Kiana thinks two integers are friends if and only if one of them divides the other one. For example, 12 and 4 are friends, also 6 and 6 are friends too, but 120 and 36 are not.A group of non-zero integers is called friendly, if each pair of its integers form a friend pair.You are given a group of non-zero integers. See if they're friendly.
