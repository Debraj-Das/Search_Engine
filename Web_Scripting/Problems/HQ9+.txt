HQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character instructions: "H" prints "Hello, World!", "Q" prints the whole source code of the program itself (at each call), "9" prints the lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song,  "+" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.Instructions "H" and "Q" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.
