Sadly, the problem setter couldn't think of an interesting story, thus he just asks you to solve the following problem.Given an array a consisting of n positive integers, count the number of non-empty subsequences for which the bitwise \mathsf{AND} of the elements in the subsequence has exactly k set bits in its binary representation. The answer may be large, so output it modulo 10^9+7.Recall that the subsequence of an array a is a sequence that can be obtained from a by removing some (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [1, 2, 3], [3], [1, 3] are subsequences of [1, 2, 3], but [3, 2] and [4, 5, 6] are not.Note that \mathsf{AND} represents the bitwise AND operation.
