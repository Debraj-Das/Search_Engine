Define the score of some binary string T as the absolute difference between the number of zeroes and ones in it. (for example, T= 010001 contains 4 zeroes and 2 ones, so the score of T is |4-2| = 2).Define the creepiness of some binary string S as the maximum score among all of its prefixes (for example, the creepiness of S= 01001 is equal to 2 because the score of the prefix S[1 \ldots 4] is 2 and the rest of the prefixes have a score of 2 or less).Given two integers a and b, construct a binary string consisting of a zeroes and b ones with the minimum possible creepiness.
