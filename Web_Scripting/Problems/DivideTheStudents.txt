Recently a lot of students were enrolled in Berland State University All students were divided into groups according to their education program Some groups turned out to be too large to attend lessons in the same auditorium so these groups should be divided into two subgroups Your task is to help divide the firstyear students of the computer science facultyThere are t new groups belonging to this faculty Students have to attend classes on three different subjects  maths programming and PE All classes are held in different places according to the subject  maths classes are held in auditoriums programming classes are held in computer labs and P E classes are held in gymsEach group should be divided into two subgroups so that there is enough space in every auditorium lab or gym for all students of the subgroup For the first subgroup of the ith group maths classes are held in an auditorium with capacity of ai 1 students programming classes are held in a lab that accomodates up to bi 1 students and PE classes are held in a gym having enough place for ci 1 students Analogically the auditorium lab and gym for the second subgroup can accept no more than ai 2 bi 2 and ci 2 students respectivelyAs usual some students skip some classes Each student considers some number of subjects from 0 to 3 to be useless  that means he skips all classes on these subjects and attends all other classes This data is given to you as follows  the ith group consists of  di 1 students which attend all classes  di 2 students which attend all classes except for PE  di 3 students which attend all classes except for programming  di 4 students which attend only maths classes  di 5 students which attend all classes except for maths  di 6 students which attend only programming classes  di 7 students which attend only PE There is one more type of students  those who dont attend any classes at all but they obviously dont need any place in auditoriums labs or gyms so the number of those students is insignificant in this problemYour task is to divide each group into two subgroups so that every auditorium or lab or gym assigned to each subgroup has enough place for all students from this subgroup attending the corresponding classes if it is possible Each student of the ith group should belong to exactly one subgroup of the ith group it is forbidden to move students between groups
