The Berland road network consists of n cities and of m bidirectional roads. The cities are numbered from 1 to n, where the main capital city has number n, and the culture capital — number 1. The road network is set up so that it is possible to reach any city from any other one by the roads. Moving on each road in any direction takes the same time.All residents of Berland are very lazy people, and so when they want to get from city v to city u, they always choose one of the shortest paths (no matter which one).The Berland government wants to make this country's road network safer. For that, it is going to put a police station in one city. The police station has a rather strange property: when a citizen of Berland is driving along the road with a police station at one end of it, the citizen drives more carefully, so all such roads are considered safe. The roads, both ends of which differ from the city with the police station, are dangerous.Now the government wonders where to put the police station so that the average number of safe roads for all the shortest paths from the cultural capital to the main capital would take the maximum value.
