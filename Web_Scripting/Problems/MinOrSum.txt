You are given an array a of size n.You can perform the following operation on the array:   Choose two different integers i, j (1 \leq i < j \leq n), replace a_i with x and a_j with y. In order not to break the array, a_i | a_j = x | y must be held, where | denotes the bitwise OR operation. Notice that x and y are non-negative integers. Please output the minimum sum of the array you can get after using the operation above any number of times.
