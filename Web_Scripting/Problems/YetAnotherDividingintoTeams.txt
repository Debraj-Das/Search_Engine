You are a coach of a group consisting of n students. The i-th student has programming skill a_i. All students have distinct programming skills. You want to divide them into teams in such a way that:  No two students i and j such that |a_i - a_j| = 1 belong to the same team (i.e. skills of each pair of students in the same team have the difference strictly greater than 1);  the number of teams is the minimum possible. You have to answer q independent queries.
