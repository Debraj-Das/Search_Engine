You are given two arrays of integers a_1,\ldots,a_n and b_1,\ldots,b_m.Your task is to find a non-empty array c_1,\ldots,c_k that is a subsequence of a_1,\ldots,a_n, and also a subsequence of b_1,\ldots,b_m. If there are multiple answers, find one of the smallest possible length. If there are still multiple of the smallest possible length, find any. If there are no such arrays, you should report about it.A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1] and [4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4].
