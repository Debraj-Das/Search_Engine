It is an interactive problem.Vasya enjoys solving quizzes. He found a strange device and wants to know how it works.This device encrypted with the tree (connected undirected graph without cycles) with n vertices, numbered with integers from 1 to n. To solve this quiz you should guess this tree.Fortunately, this device can make one operation, using which you should guess the cipher. You can give the device an array d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n of non-negative integers. On the device, there are n lamps, i-th of them is connected with i-th vertex of the tree. For all i the light will turn on the i-th lamp, if there exist such vertex of the tree with number j \neq i that dist(i, j) \leq d_j. Let's define dist(i, j) as the distance between vertices i and j in tree or number of edges on the simple path between vertices i and j.Vasya wants to solve this quiz using \leq 80 operations with the device and guess the tree. Help him!
