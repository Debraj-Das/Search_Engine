Phoenix is picking berries in his backyard. There are n shrubs, and each shrub has a_i red berries and b_i blue berries.Each basket can contain k berries. But, Phoenix has decided that each basket may only contain berries from the same shrub or berries of the same color (red or blue). In other words, all berries in a basket must be from the same shrub or/and have the same color.For example, if there are two shrubs with 5 red and 2 blue berries in the first shrub and 2 red and 1 blue berries in the second shrub then Phoenix can fill 2 baskets of capacity 4 completely:   the first basket will contain 3 red and 1 blue berries from the first shrub;  the second basket will contain the 2 remaining red berries from the first shrub and 2 red berries from the second shrub. Help Phoenix determine the maximum number of baskets he can fill completely!
