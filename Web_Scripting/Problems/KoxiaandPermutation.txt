Reve has two integers n and k.Let p be a permutation^\dagger of length n. Let c be an array of length n - k + 1 such that c_i = \max(p_i, \dots, p_{i+k-1}) + \min(p_i, \dots, p_{i+k-1}). Let the cost of the permutation p be the maximum element of c.Koxia wants you to construct a permutation with the minimum possible cost.^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
