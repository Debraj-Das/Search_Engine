Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.One day Petya dreamt of a lexicographically k-th permutation of integers from 1 to n. Determine how many lucky numbers in the permutation are located on the positions whose indexes are also lucky numbers.
