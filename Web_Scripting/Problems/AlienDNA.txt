Professor Bajtocy is conducting experiments on alien DNA He has discovered that it is subject to repetitive mutations  each mutation happens in the same way some continuous subsequence of the alien DNA becomes active copies itself the copy gets mangled and inserts itself right after the original subsequence The mangled copy of the activated continuous subsequence is formed by first joining all the elements at the even positions in that subsequence and then joining all the elements at the odd ones at the end That is if the activated subsequence consists of 11 elements and represented as s1s2 s11 its mangled copy is s2s4s6s8s10s1s3s5s7s9s11For example if the original sequence was ACTGG and the mutation happened on the segment 24 that is the activated subsequence is CTG the mutated DNA is ACTGTCGG The mangled copy of the activated subsequence is marked with bold fontProfessor Bajtocy has written down the original DNA sequence and the mutations that sequentially happened to it and he now asks you to recover the first k elements of the DNA sequence after all the mutations
