You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n consisting of n pairwise distinct positive integers.Find \left\lfloor \frac n 2 \right\rfloor different pairs of integers x and y such that:   x \neq y;  x and y appear in a;  x~mod~y doesn't appear in a. Note that some x or y can belong to multiple pairs.\lfloor x \rfloor denotes the floor function — the largest integer less than or equal to x. x~mod~y denotes the remainder from dividing x by y.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be shown that at least one solution always exists.
