n boys and m girls came to the party. Each boy presented each girl some integer number of sweets (possibly zero). All boys are numbered with integers from 1 to n and all girls are numbered with integers from 1 to m. For all 1 \leq i \leq n the minimal number of sweets, which i-th boy presented to some girl is equal to b_i and for all 1 \leq j \leq m the maximal number of sweets, which j-th girl received from some boy is equal to g_j.More formally, let a_{i,j} be the number of sweets which the i-th boy give to the j-th girl. Then b_i is equal exactly to the minimum among values a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \ldots, a_{i,m} and g_j is equal exactly to the maximum among values b_{1,j}, b_{2,j}, \ldots, b_{n,j}.You are interested in the minimum total number of sweets that boys could present, so you need to minimize the sum of a_{i,j} for all (i,j) such that 1 \leq i \leq n and 1 \leq j \leq m. You are given the numbers b_1, \ldots, b_n and g_1, \ldots, g_m, determine this number.
