You are given an n \times m grid a of non-negative integers. The value a_{i,j} represents the depth of water at the i-th row and j-th column. A lake is a set of cells such that:  each cell in the set has a_{i,j} > 0, and  there exists a path between any pair of cells in the lake by going up, down, left, or right a number of times and without stepping on a cell with a_{i,j} = 0. The volume of a lake is the sum of depths of all the cells in the lake.Find the largest volume of a lake in the grid.
