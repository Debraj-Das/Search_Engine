This in an interactive problem.There is an unknown tree consisting of n nodes, which has exactly one centroid. You only know n at first, and your task is to find the centroid of the tree.You can ask the distance between any two vertices for at most 2\cdot10^5 times. Note that the interactor is not adaptive. That is, the tree is fixed in each test beforehand and does not depend on your queries.A vertex is called a centroid if its removal splits the tree into subtrees with at most \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor vertices each.
