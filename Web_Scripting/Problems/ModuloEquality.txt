You are given a positive integer m and two integer sequence: a=[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] and b=[b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n]. Both of these sequence have a length n.Permutation is a sequence of n different positive integers from 1 to n. For example, these sequences are permutations: [1], [1,2], [2,1], [6,7,3,4,1,2,5]. These are not: [0], [1,1], [2,3].You need to find the non-negative integer x, and increase all elements of a_i by x, modulo m (i.e. you want to change a_i to (a_i + x) \bmod m), so it would be possible to rearrange elements of a to make it equal b, among them you need to find the smallest possible x.In other words, you need to find the smallest non-negative integer x, for which it is possible to find some permutation p=[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n], such that for all 1 \leq i \leq n, (a_i + x) \bmod m = b_{p_i}, where y \bmod m — remainder of division of y by m.For example, if m=3, a = [0, 0, 2, 1], b = [2, 0, 1, 1], you can choose x=1, and a will be equal to [1, 1, 0, 2] and you can rearrange it to make it equal [2, 0, 1, 1], which is equal to b.
