You are given two strings s and t, both consisting of exactly k lowercase Latin letters, s is lexicographically less than t.Let's consider list of all strings consisting of exactly k lowercase Latin letters, lexicographically not less than s and not greater than t (including s and t) in lexicographical order. For example, for k=2, s="az" and t="bf" the list will be ["az", "ba", "bb", "bc", "bd", "be", "bf"].Your task is to print the median (the middle element) of this list. For the example above this will be "bc".It is guaranteed that there is an odd number of strings lexicographically not less than s and not greater than t.
