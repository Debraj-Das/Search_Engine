You are given an integer k and a string s that consists only of characters 'a' (a lowercase Latin letter) and '*' (an asterisk).Each asterisk should be replaced with several (from 0 to k inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisk can be replaced with different counts of letter 'b'.The result of the replacement is called a BA-string.Two strings a and b are different if they either have different lengths or there exists such a position i that a_i \neq b_i.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:   a is a prefix of b, but a \ne b;  in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. Now consider all different BA-strings and find the x-th lexicographically smallest of them.
