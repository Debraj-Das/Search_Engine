You want to type the string s, consisting of n lowercase Latin letters, using your favorite text editor Notepad#.Notepad# supports two kinds of operations:   append any letter to the end of the string;  copy a continuous substring of an already typed string and paste this substring to the end of the string. Can you type string s in strictly less than n operations?
