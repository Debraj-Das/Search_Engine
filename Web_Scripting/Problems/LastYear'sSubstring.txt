Polycarp has a string s[1 \dots n] of length n consisting of decimal digits. Polycarp performs the following operation with the string s no more than once (i.e. he can perform operation 0 or 1 time):   Polycarp selects two numbers i and j (1 \leq i \leq j \leq n) and removes characters from the s string at the positions i, i+1, i+2, \ldots, j (i.e. removes substring s[i \dots j]). More formally, Polycarp turns the string s into the string s_1 s_2 \ldots s_{i-1} s_{j+1} s_{j+2} \ldots s_{n}. For example, the string s = "20192020" Polycarp can turn into strings:   "2020" (in this case (i, j)=(3, 6) or (i, j)=(1, 4));  "2019220" (in this case (i, j)=(6, 6));  "020" (in this case (i, j)=(1, 5));  other operations are also possible, only a few of them are listed above. Polycarp likes the string "2020" very much, so he is wondering if it is possible to turn the string s into a string "2020" in no more than one operation? Note that you can perform zero operations.
