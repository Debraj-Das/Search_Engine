Santa Claus has received letters from n different kids throughout this year. Of course, each kid wants to get some presents from Santa: in particular, the i-th kid asked Santa to give them one of k_i different items as a present. Some items could have been asked by multiple kids.Santa is really busy, so he wants the New Year Bot to choose the presents for all children. Unfortunately, the Bot's algorithm of choosing presents is bugged. To choose a present for some kid, the Bot does the following:  choose one kid x equiprobably among all n kids;  choose some item y equiprobably among all k_x items kid x wants;  choose a kid z who will receive the present equipropably among all n kids (this choice is independent of choosing x and y); the resulting triple (x, y, z) is called the decision of the Bot. If kid z listed item y as an item they want to receive, then the decision valid. Otherwise, the Bot's choice is invalid.Santa is aware of the bug, but he can't estimate if this bug is really severe. To do so, he wants to know the probability that one decision generated according to the aforementioned algorithm is valid. Can you help him?
