You are given an array a of length n that consists of zeros and ones.You can perform the following operation multiple times. The operation consists of two steps:   Choose three integers 1 \le x < y < z \le n, that form an arithmetic progression (y - x = z - y).  Flip the values a_x, a_y, a_z (i.e. change 1 to 0, change 0 to 1). Determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero. If yes, print the operations that lead the the all-zero state. Your solution should not contain more than (\lfloor \frac{n}{3} \rfloor + 12) operations. Here \lfloor q \rfloor denotes the number q rounded down. We can show that it is possible to make all elements equal to zero in no more than this number of operations whenever it is possible to do so at all.
