You are given two strings s and t both of length 2 and both consisting only of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.Possible examples of strings s and t: "ab", "ca", "bb".You have to find a string res consisting of 3n characters, n characters should be 'a', n characters should be 'b' and n characters should be 'c' and s and t should not occur in res as substrings.A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. So, the strings "ab", "ac" and "cc" are substrings of the string "abacc", but the strings "bc", "aa" and "cb" are not substrings of the string "abacc".If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
