God's Blessing on This PermutationForces!A Random PebbleYou are given a permutation p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n of length n and a positive integer k \le n. In one operation you can choose two indices i and j (1 \le i < j \le n) and swap p_i with p_j.Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum p_1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_k as small as possible.A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
