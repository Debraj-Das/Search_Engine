Monocarp is the coach of the Berland State University programming teams. He decided to compose a problemset for a training session for his teams.Monocarp has n problems that none of his students have seen yet. The i-th problem has a topic a_i (an integer from 1 to n) and a difficulty b_i (an integer from 1 to n). All problems are different, that is, there are no two tasks that have the same topic and difficulty at the same time.Monocarp decided to select exactly 3 problems from n problems for the problemset. The problems should satisfy at least one of two conditions (possibly, both):  the topics of all three selected problems are different;  the difficulties of all three selected problems are different. Your task is to determine the number of ways to select three problems for the problemset.
