You are given N qubits 1N8 in zero state  You are also given a bitstring bits which describes a nonzero basis state on N qubits Your task is to generate a state which is an equal superposition of  and the given basis stateYou have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs an array of qubits qs an arrays of boolean values bits representing the basis state  This array will have the same length as the array of qubits The first element of this array bits0 will be trueThe operation doesnt have an output its output is the state in which it leaves the qubitsAn array of boolean values represents a basis state as follows the ith element of the array is true if the ith qubit is in state  and false if it is in state  For example array true false describes 2qubit state  and in this case the resulting state should be Your code should have the following signaturenamespace Solution     open MicrosoftQuantumPrimitive    open MicrosoftQuantumCanon    operation Solve qs  Qubit bits  Bool              body                     your code here
