There are n cities situated along the main road of Berland Cities are represented by their coordinates  integer numbers a1a2an All coordinates are pairwise distinctIt is possible to get from one city to another only by bus But all buses and roads are very old so the Minister of Transport decided to build a new bus route The Minister doesnt want to spend large amounts of money  he wants to choose two cities in such a way that the distance between them is minimal possible The distance between two cities is equal to the absolute value of the difference between their coordinatesIt is possible that there are multiple pairs of cities with minimal possible distance so the Minister wants to know the quantity of such pairs Your task is to write a program that will calculate the minimal possible distance between two pairs of cities and the quantity of pairs which have this distance
