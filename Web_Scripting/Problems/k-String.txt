A string is called a k-string if it can be represented as k concatenated copies of some string. For example, the string "aabaabaabaab" is at the same time a 1-string, a 2-string and a 4-string, but it is not a 3-string, a 5-string, or a 6-string and so on. Obviously any string is a 1-string.You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase English letters and a positive integer k. Your task is to reorder the letters in the string s in such a way that the resulting string is a k-string.
