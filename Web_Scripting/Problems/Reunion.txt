It is reported that the 2050 Conference will be held in Yunqi Town in Hangzhou from April 23 to 25, including theme forums, morning jogging, camping and so on.The relationship between the n volunteers of the 2050 Conference can be represented by a tree (a connected undirected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges). The n vertices of the tree corresponds to the n volunteers and are numbered by 1,2,\ldots, n.We define the distance between two volunteers i and j, dis(i,j) as the number of edges on the shortest path from vertex i to vertex j on the tree. dis(i,j)=0 whenever i=j.Some of the volunteers can attend the on-site reunion while others cannot. If for some volunteer x and nonnegative integer r, all volunteers whose distance to x is no more than r can attend the on-site reunion, a forum with radius r can take place. The level of the on-site reunion is defined as the maximum possible radius of any forum that can take place.Assume that each volunteer can attend the on-site reunion with probability \frac{1}{2} and these events are independent. Output the expected level of the on-site reunion. When no volunteer can attend, the level is defined as -1. When all volunteers can attend, the level is defined as n.
