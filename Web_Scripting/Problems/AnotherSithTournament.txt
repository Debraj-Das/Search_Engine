The rules of Sith Tournament are well known to everyone. n Sith take part in the Tournament. The Tournament starts with the random choice of two Sith who will fight in the first battle. As one of them loses, his place is taken by the next randomly chosen Sith who didn't fight before. Does it need to be said that each battle in the Sith Tournament ends with a death of one of opponents? The Tournament ends when the only Sith remains alive.Jedi Ivan accidentally appeared in the list of the participants in the Sith Tournament.

Of course, he won't miss his chance to take advantage of it. Help him to calculate the probability of his victory.
