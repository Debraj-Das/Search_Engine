Ehab has an array a of n integers. He likes the bitwise-xor operation and he likes to bother Mahmoud so he came up with a problem. He gave Mahmoud q queries. In each of them, he gave Mahmoud 2 integers l and x, and asked him to find the number of subsequences of the first l elements of the array such that their bitwise-xor sum is x. Can you help Mahmoud answer the queries?A subsequence can contain elements that are not neighboring.
