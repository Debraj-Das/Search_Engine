Sergey just turned five years old! When he was one year old, his parents gave him a number; when he was two years old, his parents gave him an array of integers. On his third birthday he received a string. When he was four, his mother woke him up in a quiet voice, wished him to be a good boy and gave him a rooted tree. Today he celebrates his birthday again! He found a directed graph without loops as a present from his parents.Since Sergey is a very curious boy, he immediately came up with a thing to do. He decided to find a set Q of vertices in this graph, such that no two vertices x, y \in Q are connected by an edge, and it is possible to reach any vertex z \notin Q from some vertex of Q in no more than two moves.  After a little thought, Sergey was able to solve this task. Can you solve it too?A vertex y is reachable from a vertex x in at most two moves if either there is a directed edge (x,y), or there exist two directed edges (x,z) and (z, y) for some vertex z.
