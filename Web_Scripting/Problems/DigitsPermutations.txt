Andrey's favourite number is n. Andrey's friends gave him two identical numbers n as a New Year present. He hung them on a wall and watched them adoringly.Then Andrey got bored from looking at the same number and he started to swap digits first in one, then in the other number, then again in the first number and so on (arbitrary number of changes could be made in each number). At some point it turned out that if we sum the resulting numbers, then the number of zeroes with which the sum will end would be maximum among the possible variants of digit permutations in those numbers.Given number n, can you find the two digit permutations that have this property?
