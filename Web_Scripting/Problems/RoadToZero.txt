You are given two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations:   Pay a dollars and increase or decrease any of these integers by 1. For example, if x = 0 and y = 7 there are four possible outcomes after this operation:   x = 0, y = 6;  x = 0, y = 8;  x = -1, y = 7;  x = 1, y = 7.   Pay b dollars and increase or decrease both integers by 1. For example, if x = 0 and y = 7 there are two possible outcomes after this operation:   x = -1, y = 6;  x = 1, y = 8.  Your goal is to make both given integers equal zero simultaneously, i.e. x = y = 0. There are no other requirements. In particular, it is possible to move from x=1, y=0 to x=y=0.Calculate the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend on it.
