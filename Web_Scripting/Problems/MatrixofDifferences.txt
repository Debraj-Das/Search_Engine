For a square matrix of integers of size n \times n, let's define its beauty as follows: for each pair of side-adjacent elements x and y, write out the number |x-y|, and then find the number of different numbers among them.For example, for the matrix \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3\\ 4 & 2 \end{pmatrix} the numbers we consider are |1-3|=2, |1-4|=3, |3-2|=1 and |4-2|=2; there are 3 different numbers among them (2, 3 and 1), which means that its beauty is equal to 3.You are given an integer n. You have to find a matrix of size n \times n, where each integer from 1 to n^2 occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is the maximum possible among all such matrices.
