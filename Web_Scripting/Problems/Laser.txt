Petya is the most responsible worker in the Research Institute So he was asked to make a very important experiment to melt the chocolate bar with a new laser device The device consists of a rectangular field of nm cells and a robotic arm Each cell of the field is a 11 square The robotic arm has two lasers pointed at the field perpendicularly to its surface At any one time lasers are pointed at the centres of some two cells Since the lasers are on the robotic hand their movements are synchronized  if you move one of the lasers by a vector another one moves by the same vectorThe following facts about the experiment are known   initially the whole field is covered with a chocolate bar of the size nm both lasers are located above the field and are active  the chocolate melts within one cell of the field at which the laser is pointed  all moves of the robotic arm should be parallel to the sides of the field after each move the lasers should be pointed at the centres of some two cells  at any one time both lasers should be pointed at the field Petya doesnt want to become a second Gordon Freeman You are given n m and the cells x1y1 and x2y2 where the lasers are initially pointed at xi is a column number yi is a row number Rows are numbered from 1 to m from top to bottom and columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right You are to find the amount of cells of the field on which the chocolate cant be melted in the given conditions
