In the city of Saint Petersburg, a day lasts for 2^{100} minutes. From the main station of Saint Petersburg, a train departs after 1 minute, 4 minutes, 16 minutes, and so on; in other words, the train departs at time 4^k for each integer k \geq 0. Team BowWow has arrived at the station at the time s and it is trying to count how many trains have they missed; in other words, the number of trains that have departed strictly before time s. For example if s = 20, then they missed trains which have departed at 1, 4 and 16. As you are the only one who knows the time, help them!Note that the number s will be given you in a binary representation without leading zeroes.
