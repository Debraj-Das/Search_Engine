You are given two arrays a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n.In one operation, you can choose any integer i from 1 to n and swap the numbers a_i and b_i.Determine whether, after using any (possibly zero) number of operations, the following two conditions can be satisfied simultaneously:  a_n = \max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n),  b_n = \max(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n). Here \max(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k) denotes the maximum number among c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k. For example, \max(3, 5, 4) = 5, \max(1, 7, 7) = 7, \max(6, 2) = 6.
