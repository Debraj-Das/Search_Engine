You're given a positive integer n.Find a permutation a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that for any 1 \leq l < r \leq n, the sum a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_r is not divisible by r-l+1.A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
