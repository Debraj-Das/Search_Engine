A famous sculptor Cicasso goes to a world tourWell it is not actually a worldwide But not everyone should have the opportunity to see works of sculptor shouldnt he Otherwise there will be no any exclusivity So Cicasso will entirely hold the world tour in his native country  BerlandCicasso is very devoted to his work and he wants to be distracted as little as possible Therefore he will visit only four cities These cities will be different so no one could think that he has favourites Of course to save money he will chose the shortest paths between these cities But as you have probably guessed Cicasso is a weird person Although he doesnt like to organize exhibitions he likes to travel around the country and enjoy its scenery So he wants the total distance which he will travel to be as large as possible However the sculptor is bad in planning so he asks you for help There are n cities and m oneway roads in Berland You have to choose four different cities which Cicasso will visit and also determine the order in which he will visit them So that the total distance he will travel if he visits cities in your order starting from the first city in your list and ending in the last choosing each time the shortest route between a pair of cities  will be the largest Note that intermediate routes may pass through the cities which are assigned to the tour as well as pass twice through the same city For example the tour can look like that  Four cities in the order of visiting marked as overlines 1524Note that Berland is a hightech country So using nanotechnologies all roads were altered so that they have the same length For the same reason moving using regular cars is not very popular in the country and it can happen that there are such pairs of cities one of which generally can not be reached by car from the other one However Cicasso is very conservative and cannot travel without the car Choose cities so that the sculptor can make the tour using only the automobile It is guaranteed that it is always possible to do
