Everool has a binary string s of length 2n. Note that a binary string is a string consisting of only characters 0 and 1. He wants to partition s into two disjoint equal subsequences. He needs your help to do it.You are allowed to do the following operation exactly once.   You can choose any subsequence (possibly empty) of s and rotate it right by one position. In other words, you can select a sequence of indices b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m, where 1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \ldots < b_m \le 2n. After that you simultaneously set s_{b_1} := s_{b_m}, s_{b_2} := s_{b_1}, \ldots, s_{b_m} := s_{b_{m-1}}.Can you partition s into two disjoint equal subsequences after performing the allowed operation exactly once?A partition of s into two disjoint equal subsequences s^p and s^q is two increasing arrays of indices p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n and q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n, such that each integer from 1 to 2n is encountered in either p or q exactly once, s^p = s_{p_1} s_{p_2} \ldots s_{p_n}, s^q = s_{q_1} s_{q_2} \ldots s_{q_n}, and s^p = s^q.If it is not possible to partition after performing any kind of operation, report -1. If it is possible to do the operation and partition s into two disjoint subsequences s^p and s^q, such that s^p = s^q, print elements of b and indices of s^p, i. e. the values p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n.
