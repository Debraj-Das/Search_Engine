In the probability theory the following paradox called Benfords law is known In many lists of random numbers taken from real sources numbers starting with digit 1 occur much more often than numbers starting with any other digit thats the simplest form of the lawHaving read about it on Codeforces the Hedgehog got intrigued by the statement and wishes to thoroughly explore it He finds the following similar problem interesting in particular there are N random variables the ith of which can take any integer value from some segment LiRi all numbers from this segment are equiprobable It means that the value of the ith quantity can be equal to any integer number from a given interval LiRi with probability 1RiLi1The Hedgehog wants to know the probability of the event that the first digits of at least K of those values will be equal to one In other words let us consider some set of fixed values of these random variables and leave only the first digit the MSD  most significant digit of each value Then lets count how many times the digit 1 is encountered and if it is encountered in at least K per cent of those N values than such set of values will be called a good one You have to find the probability that a set of values of the given random variables will be a good one
