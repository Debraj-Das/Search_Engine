The array a with n integers is given. Let's call the sequence of one or more consecutive elements in a segment. Also let's call the segment k-good if it contains no more than k different values.Find any longest k-good segment.As the input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.
