Pieguy and Piegirl are playing a game. They have a rooted binary tree, that has a property that each node is either a leaf or has exactly two children. Each leaf has a number associated with it.On his/her turn a player can choose any two leafs that share their immediate parent, remove them, and associate either of their values with their parent, that now became a leaf (the player decides which of the two values to associate). The game ends when only one node (the one that was the root of the tree) is left.Pieguy goes first, and his goal is to maximize the value that will be associated with the root when the game ends. Piegirl wants to minimize that value. Assuming that both players are playing optimally, what number will be associated with the root when the game ends?
