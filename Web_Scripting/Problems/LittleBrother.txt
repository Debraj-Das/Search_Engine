Masha's little brother draw two points on a sheet of paper. After that, he draws some circles and gave the sheet to his sister. Masha has just returned from geometry lesson so she instantly noticed some interesting facts about brother's drawing.At first, the line going through two points, that brother drew, doesn't intersect or touch any circle.Also, no two circles intersect or touch, and there is no pair of circles such that one circle is located inside another.Moreover, for each circle, Masha drew a square of the minimal area with sides parallel axis such that this circle is located inside the square and noticed that there is no two squares intersect or touch and there is no pair of squares such that one square is located inside other.Now Masha wants to draw circle of minimal possible radius such that it goes through two points that brother drew and doesn't intersect any other circle, but other circles can touch Masha's circle and can be located inside it.It's guaranteed, that answer won't exceed 1012. It should be held for hacks as well.
