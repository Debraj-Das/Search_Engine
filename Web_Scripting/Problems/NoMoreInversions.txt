You have a sequence a with n elements 1, 2, 3, \dots, k - 1, k, k - 1, k - 2, \dots, k - (n - k) (k \le n < 2k).Let's call as inversion in a a pair of indices i < j such that a[i] > a[j].Suppose, you have some permutation p of size k and you build a sequence b of size n in the following manner: b[i] = p[a[i]].Your goal is to find such permutation p that the total number of inversions in b doesn't exceed the total number of inversions in a, and b is lexicographically maximum.Small reminder: the sequence of k integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to k exactly once.Another small reminder: a sequence s is lexicographically smaller than another sequence t, if either s is a prefix of t, or for the first i such that s_i \ne t_i, s_i < t_i holds (in the first position that these sequences are different, s has smaller number than t).
