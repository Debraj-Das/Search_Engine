Omkar has received a message from Anton saying "Your story for problem A is confusing. Just make a formal statement." Because of this, Omkar gives you an array a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] of n distinct integers. An array b = [b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k] is called nice if for any two distinct elements b_i, b_j of b, |b_i-b_j| appears in b at least once. In addition, all elements in b must be distinct. Can you add several (maybe, 0) integers to a to create a nice array b of size at most 300? If a is already nice, you don't have to add any elements.For example, array [3, 6, 9] is nice, as |6-3|=|9-6| = 3, which appears in the array, and |9-3| = 6, which appears in the array, while array [4, 2, 0, 6, 9] is not nice, as |9-4| = 5 is not present in the array.For integers x and y, |x-y| = x-y if x > y and |x-y| = y-x otherwise.
