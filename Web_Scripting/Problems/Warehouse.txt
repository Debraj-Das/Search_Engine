Once upon a time when the world was more beautiful the sun shone brighter the grass was greener and the sausages tasted better Arlandia was the most powerful country And its capital was the place where our hero DravDe worked He couldnt program or make up problems in fact few people saw a computer those days but he was nevertheless happy He worked in a warehouse where a magical but nonalcoholic drink OgudarOlok was kept We wont describe his work in detail and take a better look at a simplified version of the warehouseThe warehouse has one set of shelving It has n shelves each of which is divided into m sections The shelves are numbered from top to bottom starting from 1 and the sections of each shelf are numbered from left to right also starting from 1 Each section can contain exactly one box of the drink and try as he might DravDe can never put a box in a section that already has one In the course of his work DravDe frequently notices that he has to put a box in a filled section In that case his solution is simple DravDe ignores that section and looks at the next one to the right If it is empty he puts the box there Otherwise he keeps looking for the first empty section to the right If no empty section is found by the end of the shelf he looks at the shelf which is under it then the next one etc Also each time he looks at a new shelf he starts from the shelfs beginning If DravDe still cant find an empty section for the box he immediately drinks it all up and throws the empty bottles away not to be caughtAfter one great party with a lot of OgudarOlok drunk DravDe asked you to help him Unlike him you can program and therefore modeling the process of counting the boxes in the warehouse will be easy work for youThe process of counting contains two types of query messages   1 x y id where x y are integers 1xn 1ym and id is a string of lower case Latin letters  from 1 to 10 characters long That query means that the warehouse got a box identified as id which should be put in the section y on the shelf x If the section is full use the rules described above It is guaranteed that every moment of the process the identifiers of all the boxes in the warehouse are different You dont have to answer this query  1 id where id is a string of lower case Latin letters  from 1 to 10 characters long That query means that a box identified as id is removed from the warehouse You have to answer this query see output format
