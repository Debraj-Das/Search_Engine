One day, as Sherlock Holmes was tracking down one very important criminal, he found a wonderful painting on the wall. This wall could be represented as a plane. The painting had several concentric circles that divided the wall into several parts. Some parts were painted red and all the other were painted blue. Besides, any two neighboring parts were painted different colors, that is, the red and the blue color were alternating, i. e. followed one after the other. The outer area of the wall (the area that lied outside all circles) was painted blue. Help Sherlock Holmes determine the total area of red parts of the wall.Let us remind you that two circles are called concentric if their centers coincide. Several circles are called concentric if any two of them are concentric.
