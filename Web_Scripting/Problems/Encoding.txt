Polycarp invented a new way to encode strings Lets assume that we have string T consisting of lowercase English letters Lets choose several pairs of letters of the English alphabet in such a way that each letter occurs in at most one pair Then lets replace each letter in T with its pair letter if there is a pair letter for it For example if you chose pairs l r p q and a o then word parallelogram according to the given encoding principle transforms to word qolorreraglomPolycarpus already has two strings S and T He suspects that string T was obtained after applying the given encoding method from some substring of string S Find all positions mi in S 1miST1 such that T can be obtained fro substring SmiSmi1 SmiT1 by applying the described encoding operation by using some set of pairs of English alphabet letters
