Moamen was drawing a grid of n rows and 10^9 columns containing only digits 0 and 1. Ezzat noticed what Moamen was drawing and became interested in the minimum number of rows one needs to remove to make the grid beautiful.A grid is beautiful if and only if for every two consecutive rows there is at least one column containing 1 in these two rows.Ezzat will give you the number of rows n, and m segments of the grid that contain digits 1. Every segment is represented with three integers i, l, and r, where i represents the row number, and l and r represent the first and the last column of the segment in that row.For example, if n = 3, m = 6, and the segments are (1,1,1), (1,7,8), (2,7,7), (2,15,15), (3,1,1), (3,15,15), then the grid is:  Your task is to tell Ezzat the minimum number of rows that should be removed to make the grid beautiful.
