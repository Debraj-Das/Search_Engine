Despite his bad reputation, Captain Flint is a friendly person (at least, friendly to animals). Now Captain Flint is searching worthy sailors to join his new crew (solely for peaceful purposes). A sailor is considered as worthy if he can solve Flint's task.Recently, out of blue Captain Flint has been interested in math and even defined a new class of integers. Let's define a positive integer x as nearly prime if it can be represented as p \cdot q, where 1 < p < q and p and q are prime numbers. For example, integers 6 and 10 are nearly primes (since 2 \cdot 3 = 6 and 2 \cdot 5 = 10), but integers 1, 3, 4, 16, 17 or 44 are not.Captain Flint guessed an integer n and asked you: can you represent it as the sum of 4 different positive integers where at least 3 of them should be nearly prime.Uncle Bogdan easily solved the task and joined the crew. Can you do the same?
