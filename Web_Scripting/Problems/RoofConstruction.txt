It has finally been decided to build a roof over the football field in School 179. Its construction will require placing n consecutive vertical pillars. Furthermore, the headmaster wants the heights of all the pillars to form a permutation p of integers from 0 to n - 1, where p_i is the height of the i-th pillar from the left (1 \le i \le n).As the chief, you know that the cost of construction of consecutive pillars is equal to the maximum value of the bitwise XOR of heights of all pairs of adjacent pillars. In other words, the cost of construction is equal to \max\limits_{1 \le i \le n - 1}{p_i \oplus p_{i + 1}}, where \oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation.Find any sequence of pillar heights p of length n with the smallest construction cost.In this problem, a permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 0 to n - 1 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,0,4] is a permutation, but [1,0,1] is not a permutation (1 appears twice in the array) and [1,0,3] is also not a permutation (n=3, but 3 is in the array).
