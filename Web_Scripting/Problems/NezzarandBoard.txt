n distinct integers x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n are written on the board. Nezzar can perform the following operation multiple times.  Select two integers x,y (not necessarily distinct) on the board, and write down 2x-y. Note that you don't remove selected numbers. Now, Nezzar wonders if it is possible to have his favorite number k on the board after applying above operation multiple times.
