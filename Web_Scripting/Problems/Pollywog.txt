As we all know Dart is some kind of creature from Upside Down world For simplicity we call their kind pollywogs Dart and x1 other pollywogs are playing a game There are n stones in a row numbered from 1 through n from left to right At most 1 pollywog may be sitting on each stone at a time Initially the pollywogs are sitting on the first x stones one pollywog on each stone  Dart and his friends want to end up on the last x stones At each second the leftmost pollywog should jump to the right A pollywog can jump at most k stones more specifically a pollywog can jump from stone number i to stones i1i2 ik A pollywog cant jump on an occupied stone Jumping a distance i takes ci amounts of energy from the pollywog Also q stones are special Each time landing on a special stone p takes wp amounts of energy in addition to the energy for jump from the pollywog wp could be negative in this case it means the pollywog absorbs wp amounts of energyPollywogs want to spend as little energy as possible this value could be negative Theyre just pollywogs so they asked for your help Tell them the total change in their energy in case they move optimally
