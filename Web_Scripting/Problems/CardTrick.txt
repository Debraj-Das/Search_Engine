Monocarp has just learned a new card trick, and can't wait to present it to you. He shows you the entire deck of n cards. You see that the values of cards from the topmost to the bottommost are integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, and all values are different.Then he asks you to shuffle the deck m times. With the j-th shuffle, you should take b_j topmost cards and move them under the remaining (n - b_j) cards without changing the order.And then, using some magic, Monocarp tells you the topmost card of the deck. However, you are not really buying that magic. You tell him that you know the topmost card yourself. Can you surprise Monocarp and tell him the topmost card before he shows it?
