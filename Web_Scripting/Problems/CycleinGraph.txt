Youve got a undirected graph G consisting of n nodes We will consider the nodes of the graph indexed by integers from 1 to n We know that each node of graph G is connected by edges with at least k other nodes of this graph Your task is to find in the given graph a simple cycle of length of at least k1A simple cycle of length d d1 in graph G is a sequence of distinct graph nodes v1v2vd such that nodes v1 and vd are connected by an edge of the graph also for any integer i 1id nodes vi and vi1 are connected by an edge of the graph
