We all know that a superhero can transform to certain other superheroes. But not all Superheroes can transform to any other superhero. A superhero with name s can transform to another superhero with name t if s can be made equal to t by changing any vowel in s to any other vowel and any consonant in s to any other consonant. Multiple changes can be made.In this problem, we consider the letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u' to be vowels and all the other letters to be consonants.Given the names of two superheroes, determine if the superhero with name s can be transformed to the Superhero with name t.
