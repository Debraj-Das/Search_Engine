There are n children who study at the school 41 It is wellknown that they are good mathematicians Once at a break they arranged a challenge for themselves All children arranged in a row and turned heads either to the left or to the rightChildren can do the following in one secondseveral pairs of neighboring children who are looking at each other can simultaneously turn the head in the opposite direction For instance the one who was looking at the right neighbor turns left and vice versa for the second child Moreover every second at least one pair of neighboring children performs such action They are going to finish when there is no pair of neighboring children who are looking at each other You are given the number n the initial arrangement of children and the number k You have to find a way for the children to act if they want to finish the process in exactly k seconds More formally for each of the k moves you need to output the numbers of the children who turn left during this moveFor instance for the configuration shown below and k  2 children can do the following steps    At the beginning two pairs make move 1 2 and 3 4 After that we receive the following configuration    At the second move pair 2 3 makes the move The final configuration is reached Good job   It is guaranteed that if the solution exists it takes not more than n2 headturns
