You are given an array a consisting of n integers, and q queries to it. i-th query is denoted by two integers l_i and r_i. For each query, you have to find any integer that occurs exactly once in the subarray of a from index l_i to index r_i (a subarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array). For example, if a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4], then for query (l_i = 2, r_i = 6) the subarray we are interested in is [1, 2, 3, 2, 4], and possible answers are 1, 3 and 4; for query (l_i = 1, r_i = 2) the subarray we are interested in is [1, 1], and there is no such element that occurs exactly once.Can you answer all of the queries?
