A permutation of length n is a sequence of integers from 1 to n of length n containing each number exactly once. For example, [1], [4, 3, 5, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1] are permutations, and [1, 1], [0, 1], [2, 2, 1, 4] are not.There was a permutation p[1 \dots n]. It was merged with itself. In other words, let's take two instances of p and insert elements of the second p into the first maintaining relative order of elements. The result is a sequence of the length 2n.For example, if p=[3, 1, 2] some possible results are: [3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2], [3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2], [3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2]. The following sequences are not possible results of a merging: [1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3], [3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1], [3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1].For example, if p=[2, 1] the possible results are: [2, 2, 1, 1], [2, 1, 2, 1]. The following sequences are not possible results of a merging: [1, 1, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2, 1].Your task is to restore the permutation p by the given resulting sequence a. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique.You have to answer t independent test cases.
