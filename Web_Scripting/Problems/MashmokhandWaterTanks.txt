Mashmokh is playing a new game In the beginning he has k liters of water and p coins Additionally he has a rooted tree an undirected connected acyclic graph that consists of m vertices Each vertex of the tree contains a water tank that is empty in the beginningThe game begins with the fact that Mashmokh chooses some no more than k of these tanks except the root and pours into each of them exactly 1 liter of water Then the following process is performed until there is no water remained in tanks  The process consists of several steps  At the beginning of each step Mashmokh opens doors of all tanks Then Mashmokh closes doors of some tanks he is not allowed to close door of tank in the root for the duration of this move Lets denote the number of liters in some tank with closed door as w Mashmokh pays w coins for the closing of that tank during this move  Lets denote by x1x2xm as the list of vertices of the tree sorted nondecreasing by their depth The vertices from this list should be considered one by one in the order Firstly vertex x1 which is the root itself is emptied Then for each vertex xi i1 if its door is closed then skip the vertex else move all the water from the tank of vertex xi to the tank of its father even if the tank of the father is closed Suppose l moves were made until the tree became empty Lets denote the amount of water inside the tank of the root after the ith move by wi then Mashmokh will win maxw1w2wl dollars Mashmokh wanted to know what is the maximum amount of dollars he can win by playing the above game He asked you to find this value for him
