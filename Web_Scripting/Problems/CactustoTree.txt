You are given a special connected undirected graph where each vertex belongs to at most one simple cycle.Your task is to remove as many edges as needed to convert this graph into a tree (connected graph with no cycles). For each node, independently, output the maximum distance between it and a leaf in the resulting tree, assuming you were to remove the edges in a way that minimizes this distance.
