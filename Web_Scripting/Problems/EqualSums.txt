You are given k sequences of integers. The length of the i-th sequence equals to n_i.You have to choose exactly two sequences i and j (i \ne j) such that you can remove exactly one element in each of them in such a way that the sum of the changed sequence i (its length will be equal to n_i - 1) equals to the sum of the changed sequence j (its length will be equal to n_j - 1).Note that it's required to remove exactly one element in each of the two chosen sequences.Assume that the sum of the empty (of the length equals 0) sequence is 0.
