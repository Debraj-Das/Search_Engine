You are given a rooted tree consisting of n vertices The vertices are numbered from 1 to n the root is the vertex 1You can perform the following operation at most k times   choose an edge v u of the tree such that v is a parent of u  remove the edge v u  add an edge 1 u ie make u with its subtree a child of the root The height of a tree is the maximum depth of its vertices and the depth of a vertex is the number of edges on the path from the root to it For example the depth of vertex 1 is 0 since its the root and the depth of all its children is 1Whats the smallest height of the tree that can be achieved
