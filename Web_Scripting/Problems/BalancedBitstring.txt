A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1. A bitstring is called k-balanced if every substring of size k of this bitstring has an equal amount of 0 and 1 characters (\frac{k}{2} of each).You are given an integer k and a string s which is composed only of characters 0, 1, and ?. You need to determine whether you can make a k-balanced bitstring by replacing every ? characters in s with either 0 or 1.A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
