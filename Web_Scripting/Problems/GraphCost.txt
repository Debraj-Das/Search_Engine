You are given an initially empty undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 1 to n (i. e. n nodes and 0 edges). You want to add m edges to the graph, so the graph won't contain any self-loop or multiple edges.If an edge connecting two nodes u and v is added, its weight must be equal to the greatest common divisor of u and v, i. e. \gcd(u, v).In order to add edges to the graph, you can repeat the following process any number of times (possibly zero):   choose an integer k \ge 1;  add exactly k edges to the graph, each having a weight equal to k + 1. Adding these k edges costs k + 1 in total.  Note that you can't create self-loops or multiple edges. Also, if you can't add k edges of weight k + 1, you can't choose such k.For example, if you can add 5 more edges to the graph of weight 6, you may add them, and it will cost 6 for the whole pack of 5 edges. But if you can only add 4 edges of weight 6 to the graph, you can't perform this operation for k = 5.Given two integers n and m, find the minimum total cost to form a graph of n vertices and exactly m edges using the operation above. If such a graph can't be constructed, output -1.Note that the final graph may consist of several connected components.
