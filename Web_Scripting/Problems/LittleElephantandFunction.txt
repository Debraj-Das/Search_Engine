The Little Elephant enjoys recursive functionsThis time he enjoys the sorting function Let a is a permutation of an integers from 1 to n inclusive and ai denotes the ith element of the permutation The Little Elephants recursive function fx that sorts the first x permutations elements works as follows  If x1 exit the function  Otherwise call fx1 and then make swapax1ax swap the xth and x1th elements of a The Little Elephants teacher believes that this function does not work correctly But thatbe do not get an F the Little Elephant wants to show the performance of its function Help him find a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that after performing the Little Elephants function that is call fn the permutation will be sorted in ascending order
