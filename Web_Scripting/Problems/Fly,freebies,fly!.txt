Everyone loves a freebie. Especially students.It is well-known that if in the night before exam a student opens window, opens the student's record-book and shouts loudly three times "Fly, freebie, fly!" — then flown freebie helps him to pass the upcoming exam.In the night before the exam on mathematical analysis n students living in dormitory shouted treasured words. The i-th student made a sacrament at the time ti, where ti is the number of seconds elapsed since the beginning of the night.It is known that the freebie is a capricious and willful lady. That night the freebie was near dormitory only for T seconds. Therefore, if for two students their sacrament times differ for more than T, then the freebie didn't visit at least one of them.Since all students are optimists, they really want to know what is the maximal number of students visited by the freebie can be.
