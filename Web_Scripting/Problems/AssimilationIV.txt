Monocarp is playing a game "Assimilation IV". In this game he manages a great empire: builds cities and conquers new lands.Monocarp's empire has n cities. In order to conquer new lands he plans to build one Monument in each city. The game is turn-based and, since Monocarp is still amateur, he builds exactly one Monument per turn.Monocarp has m points on the map he'd like to control using the constructed Monuments. For each point he knows the distance between it and each city. Monuments work in the following way: when built in some city, a Monument controls all points at distance at most 1 to this city. Next turn, the Monument controls all points at distance at most 2, the turn after — at distance at most 3, and so on. Monocarp will build n Monuments in n turns and his empire will conquer all points that are controlled by at least one Monument.Monocarp can't figure out any strategy, so during each turn he will choose a city for a Monument randomly among all remaining cities (cities without Monuments). Monocarp wants to know how many points (among m of them) he will conquer at the end of turn number n. Help him to calculate the expected number of conquered points!
