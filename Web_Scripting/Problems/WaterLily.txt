While sailing on a boat, Inessa noticed a beautiful water lily flower above the lake's surface. She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly H centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of L centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface.  Suppose that the lily grows at some point A on the lake bottom, and its stem is always a straight segment with one endpoint at point A. Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point A, i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point A?
