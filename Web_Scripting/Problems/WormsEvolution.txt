Professor Vasechkin is studying evolution of worms. Recently he put forward hypotheses that all worms evolve by division. There are n forms of worms. Worms of these forms have lengths a1, a2, ..., an. To prove his theory, professor needs to find 3 different forms that the length of the first form is equal to sum of lengths of the other two forms. Help him to do this.
