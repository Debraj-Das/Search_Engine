Note that the memory limit in this problem is less than usual.Let's consider an array consisting of positive integers, some positions of which contain gaps.We have a collection of numbers that can be used to fill the gaps. Each number from the given collection can be used at most once.Your task is to determine such way of filling gaps that the longest increasing subsequence in the formed array has a maximum size.
