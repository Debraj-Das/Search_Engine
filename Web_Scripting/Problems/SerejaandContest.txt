During the last Serejas Codesecrof round the server crashed many times so the round was decided to be made unrated for some participants Lets assume that n people took part in the contest Lets assume that the participant who got the first place has rating a1 the second place participant has rating a2  the nth place participant has rating an Then changing the rating on the Codesecrof site is calculated by the formula After the round was over the Codesecrof management published the participants results table They decided that if for a participant dik then the round can be considered unrated for him But imagine the managements surprise when they found out that the participants rating table is dynamic In other words when some participant is removed from the rating he is removed from the results table and the rating is recalculated according to the new table And of course all applications for exclusion from the rating are considered in view of the current tableWe know that among all the applications for exclusion from the rating the first application to consider is from the participant with the best rank the rank with the minimum number for who dik We also know that the applications for exclusion from rating were submitted by all participantsNow Sereja wonders what is the number of participants to be excluded from the contest rating and the numbers of the participants in the original table in the order of their exclusion from the rating Pay attention to the analysis of the first test case for a better understanding of the statement
