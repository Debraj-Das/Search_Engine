Weve got a rectangular nmcell maze Each cell is either passable or is a wall impassable A little boy found the maze and cyclically tiled a plane with it so that the plane became an infinite maze Now on this plane cell xy is a wall if and only if cell  is a wallIn this problem  is a remainder of dividing number a by number bThe little boy stood at some cell on the plane and he wondered whether he can walk infinitely far away from his starting position From cell xy he can go to one of the following cells xy1 xy1 x1y and x1y provided that the cell he goes to is not a wall
