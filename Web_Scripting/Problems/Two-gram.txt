Two-gram is an ordered pair (i.e. string of length two) of capital Latin letters. For example, "AZ", "AA", "ZA" — three distinct two-grams.You are given a string s consisting of n capital Latin letters. Your task is to find any two-gram contained in the given string as a substring (i.e. two consecutive characters of the string) maximal number of times. For example, for string s = "BBAABBBA" the answer is two-gram "BB", which contained in s three times. In other words, find any most frequent two-gram.Note that occurrences of the two-gram can overlap with each other.
