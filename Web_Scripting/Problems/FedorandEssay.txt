After you had helped Fedor to find friends in the «Call of Soldiers 3» game, he stopped studying completely. Today, the English teacher told him to prepare an essay. Fedor didn't want to prepare the essay, so he asked Alex for help. Alex came to help and wrote the essay for Fedor. But Fedor didn't like the essay at all. Now Fedor is going to change the essay using the synonym dictionary of the English language.Fedor does not want to change the meaning of the essay. So the only change he would do: change a word from essay to one of its synonyms, basing on a replacement rule from the dictionary. Fedor may perform this operation any number of times.As a result, Fedor wants to get an essay which contains as little letters «R» (the case doesn't matter) as possible. If there are multiple essays with minimum number of «R»s he wants to get the one with minimum length (length of essay is the sum of the lengths of all the words in it). Help Fedor get the required essay.Please note that in this problem the case of letters doesn't matter. For example, if the synonym dictionary says that word cat can be replaced with word DOG, then it is allowed to replace the word Cat with the word doG.
