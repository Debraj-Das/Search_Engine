A permutation p of length n is a sequence p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n consisting of n distinct integers, each of which from 1 to n (1 \leq p_i \leq n) .Let's call the subsegment [l,r] of the permutation good if all numbers from the minimum on it to the maximum on this subsegment occur among the numbers p_l, p_{l+1}, \dots, p_r.For example, good segments of permutation [1, 3, 2, 5, 4] are:  [1, 1],  [1, 3],  [1, 5],  [2, 2],  [2, 3],  [2, 5],  [3, 3],  [4, 4],  [4, 5],  [5, 5]. You are given a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n.You need to answer q queries of the form: find the number of good subsegments of the given segment of permutation.In other words, to answer one query, you need to calculate the number of good subsegments [x \dots y] for some given segment [l \dots r], such that l \leq x \leq y \leq r.
