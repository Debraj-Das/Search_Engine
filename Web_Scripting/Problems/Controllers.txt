You are at your grandparents' house and you are playing an old video game on a strange console. Your controller has only two buttons and each button has a number written on it.Initially, your score is 0. The game is composed of n rounds. For each 1\le i\le n, the i-th round works as follows.On the screen, a symbol s_i appears, which is either \texttt{+} (plus) or \texttt{-} (minus). Then you must press one of the two buttons on the controller once. Suppose you press a button with the number x written on it: your score will increase by x if the symbol was \texttt{+} and will decrease by x if the symbol was \texttt{-}. After you press the button, the round ends. After you have played all n rounds, you win if your score is 0.Over the years, your grandparents bought many different controllers, so you have q of them. The two buttons on the j-th controller have the numbers a_j and b_j written on them. For each controller, you must compute whether you can win the game playing with that controller.
