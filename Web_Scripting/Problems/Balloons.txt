There are quite a lot of ways to have fun with inflatable balloons. For example, you can fill them with water and see what happens.Grigory and Andrew have the same opinion. So, once upon a time, they went to the shop and bought n packets with inflatable balloons, where i-th of them has exactly a_i balloons inside.They want to divide the balloons among themselves. In addition, there are several conditions to hold:  Do not rip the packets (both Grigory and Andrew should get unbroken packets);  Distribute all packets (every packet should be given to someone);  Give both Grigory and Andrew at least one packet;  To provide more fun, the total number of balloons in Grigory's packets should not be equal to the total number of balloons in Andrew's packets. Help them to divide the balloons or determine that it's impossible under these conditions.
