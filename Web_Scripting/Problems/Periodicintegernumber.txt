Alice became interested in periods of integer numbers. We say positive X integer number is periodic with length L if there exists positive integer number P with L digits such that X can be written as PPPP…P. For example:X = 123123123 is periodic number with length L = 3 and L = 9X = 42424242 is periodic number with length L = 2,L = 4 and L = 8X = 12345 is periodic number with length L = 5For given positive period length L and positive integer number A, Alice wants to find smallest integer number X strictly greater than A that is periodic with length L.
