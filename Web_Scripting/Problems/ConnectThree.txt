The Squareland national forest is divided into equal 1 \times 1 square plots aligned with north-south and east-west directions. Each plot can be uniquely described by integer Cartesian coordinates (x, y) of its south-west corner.Three friends, Alice, Bob, and Charlie are going to buy three distinct plots of land A, B, C in the forest. Initially, all plots in the forest (including the plots A, B, C) are covered by trees. The friends want to visit each other, so they want to clean some of the plots from trees. After cleaning, one should be able to reach any of the plots A, B, C from any other one of those by moving through adjacent cleared plots. Two plots are adjacent if they share a side.  For example, A=(0,0), B=(1,1), C=(2,2). The minimal number of plots to be cleared is 5. One of the ways to do it is shown with the gray color. Of course, the friends don't want to strain too much. Help them find out the smallest number of plots they need to clean from trees.
