On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles Then he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell The grasshopper wants to eat the insectOstap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current to the left or to the right Note that it doesnt matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them For example if k1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only and if k2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cellYour goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect
