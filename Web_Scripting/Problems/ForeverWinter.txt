A snowflake graph is generated from two integers x and y, both greater than 1, as follows:   Start with one central vertex.  Connect x new vertices to this central vertex.  Connect y new vertices to each of these x vertices.  For example, below is a snowflake graph for x=5 and y=3.  The snowflake graph above has a central vertex 15, then x=5 vertices attached to it (3, 6, 7, 8, and 20), and then y=3 vertices attached to each of those.  Given a snowflake graph, determine the values of x and y.
