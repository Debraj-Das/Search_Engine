You are allowed to perform the following operation on it as many times as you want (0 or more times):   Choose 2 indices i,j where 1 \le i < j \le n and replace a_k for all i \leq k \leq j with |a_i - a_j| Print the maximum sum of all the elements of the final array that you can obtain in such a way.
