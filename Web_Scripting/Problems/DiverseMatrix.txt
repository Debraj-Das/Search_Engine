Let a be a matrix of size r \times c containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from 1 to r, columns are numbered from 1 to c. We can construct an array b consisting of r + c integers as follows: for each i \in [1, r], let b_i be the greatest common divisor of integers in the i-th row, and for each j \in [1, c] let b_{r+j} be the greatest common divisor of integers in the j-th column. We call the matrix diverse if all r + c numbers b_k (k \in [1, r + c]) are pairwise distinct. The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of b_k.For example, suppose we have the following matrix: \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 9 & 7\\ 4 & 144 & 84 \end{pmatrix} We construct the array b:  b_1 is the greatest common divisor of 2, 9, and 7, that is 1;  b_2 is the greatest common divisor of 4, 144, and 84, that is 4;  b_3 is the greatest common divisor of 2 and 4, that is 2;  b_4 is the greatest common divisor of 9 and 144, that is 9;  b_5 is the greatest common divisor of 7 and 84, that is 7. So b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to 9.For a given r and c, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer 0.
