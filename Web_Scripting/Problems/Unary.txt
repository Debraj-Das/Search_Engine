Unary is a minimalistic Brainfuck dialect in which programs are written using only one token Brainfuck programs use 8 commands        and  their meaning is not important for the purposes of this problem Unary programs are created from Brainfuck programs using the following algorithm First replace each command with a corresponding binary code using the following conversion table     1000    1001    1010    1011    1100    1101    1110    1111 Next concatenate the resulting binary codes into one binary number in the same order as in the program Finally write this number using unary numeral system  this is the Unary program equivalent to the original Brainfuck oneYou are given a Brainfuck program Your task is to calculate the size of the equivalent Unary program and print it modulo 1000003 1063
