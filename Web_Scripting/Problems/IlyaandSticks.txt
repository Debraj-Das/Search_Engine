In the evening after the contest Ilya was bored and he really felt like maximizing He remembered that he had a set of n sticks and an instrument Each stick is characterized by its length liIlya decided to make a rectangle from the sticks And due to his whim he decided to make rectangles in such a way that maximizes their total area Each stick is used in making at most one rectangle it is possible that some of sticks remain unused Bending sticks is not allowedSticks with lengths a1 a2 a3 and a4 can make a rectangle if the following properties are observed  a1a2a3a4  a1a2  a3a4 A rectangle can be made of sticks with lengths of for example 3333 or 2244 A rectangle cannot be made of for example sticks 5557Ilya also has an instrument which can reduce the length of the sticks The sticks are made of a special material so the length of each stick can be reduced by at most one For example a stick with length 5 can either stay at this length or be transformed into a stick of length 4You have to answer the question  what maximum total area of the rectangles can Ilya get with a file if makes rectangles from the available sticks
