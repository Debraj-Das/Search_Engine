Masha meets a new friend and learns his phone number — s. She wants to remember it as soon as possible. The phone number — is a string of length m that consists of digits from 0 to 9. The phone number may start with 0.Masha already knows n phone numbers (all numbers have the same length m). It will be easier for her to remember a new number if the s is represented as segments of numbers she already knows. Each such segment must be of length at least 2, otherwise there will be too many segments and Masha will get confused.For example, Masha needs to remember the number: s =  '12345678' and she already knows n = 4 numbers: '12340219', '20215601', '56782022', '12300678'. You can represent s as a 3 segment: '1234' of number one, '56' of number two, and '78' of number three. There are other ways to represent s.Masha asks you for help, she asks you to break the string s into segments of length 2 or more of the numbers she already knows. If there are several possible answers, print any of them.
