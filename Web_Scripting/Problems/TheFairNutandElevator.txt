The Fair Nut lives in n story house. a_i people live on the i-th floor of the house. Every person uses elevator twice a day: to get from the floor where he/she lives to the ground (first) floor and to get from the first floor to the floor where he/she lives, when he/she comes back home in the evening. It was decided that elevator, when it is not used, will stay on the x-th floor, but x hasn't been chosen yet. When a person needs to get from floor a to floor b, elevator follows the simple algorithm:   Moves from the x-th floor (initially it stays on the x-th floor) to the a-th and takes the passenger.  Moves from the a-th floor to the b-th floor and lets out the passenger (if a equals b, elevator just opens and closes the doors, but still comes to the floor from the x-th floor).  Moves from the b-th floor back to the x-th.  The elevator never transposes more than one person and always goes back to the floor x before transposing a next passenger. The elevator spends one unit of electricity to move between neighboring floors. So moving from the a-th floor to the b-th floor requires |a - b| units of electricity.Your task is to help Nut to find the minimum number of electricity units, that it would be enough for one day, by choosing an optimal the x-th floor. Don't forget than elevator initially stays on the x-th floor.
