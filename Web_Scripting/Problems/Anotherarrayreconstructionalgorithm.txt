You are given a quantum oracle  an operation on N1 qubits which implements a function  You are guaranteed that the function f implemented by the oracle can be represented in the following form oracle from problem D2Here  a vector of N integers each of which can be 0 or 1 and  is a vector of N 1sYour task is to reconstruct the array  which could produce the given oracle Your code is allowed to call the given oracle only onceYou have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs an integer N  the number of qubits in the oracle input 1N8 an oracle Uf implemented as an operation with signature Qubit Qubit   ie an operation which takes as input an array of qubits and an output qubit and has no outputThe return of your operation is an array of integers of length N each of them 0 or 1Note that in this problem were comparing the oracle generated by your return to the oracle Uf instead of comparing your return to the hidden value of  used to generate Uf This means that any kind of incorrect return results in Runtime Error verdict as well as actual runtime errors like releasing qubits in nonzero stateYour code should have the following signaturenamespace Solution     open MicrosoftQuantumPrimitive    open MicrosoftQuantumCanon    operation Solve N  Int Uf  Qubit Qubit    Int            body                     your code here
