Recently Luba learned about a special kind of numbers that she calls beautiful numbers The number is called beautiful iff its binary representation consists of k1 consecutive ones and then k consecutive zeroesSome examples of beautiful numbers   12 110  1102 610  11110002 12010  1111100002 49610 More formally the number is beautiful iff there exists some positive integer k such that the number is equal to 2k12k1Luba has got an integer number n and she wants to find its greatest beautiful divisor Help her to find it
