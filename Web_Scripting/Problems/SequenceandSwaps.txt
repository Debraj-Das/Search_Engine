You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, and an integer x. Your task is to make the sequence a sorted (it is considered sorted if the condition a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le \dots \le a_n holds).To make the sequence sorted, you may perform the following operation any number of times you want (possibly zero): choose an integer i such that 1 \le i \le n and a_i > x, and swap the values of a_i and x.For example, if a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 4], x = 1, the following sequence of operations is possible:  choose i = 2 (it is possible since a_2 > x), then a = [0, 1, 3, 5, 4], x = 2;  choose i = 3 (it is possible since a_3 > x), then a = [0, 1, 2, 5, 4], x = 3;  choose i = 4 (it is possible since a_4 > x), then a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], x = 5. Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform so that a becomes sorted, or report that it is impossible.
