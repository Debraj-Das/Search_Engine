Om Nom really likes candies and doesnt like spiders as they frequently steal candies One day Om Nom fancied a walk in a park Unfortunately the park has some spiders and Om Nom doesnt want to see them at all  The park can be represented as a rectangular nm field The park has k spiders each spider at time 0 is at some cell of the field The spiders move all the time and each spider always moves in one of the four directions left right down up In a unit of time a spider crawls from his cell to the sideadjacent cell in the corresponding direction If there is no cell in the given direction then the spider leaves the park The spiders do not interfere with each other as they move Specifically one cell can have multiple spiders at the same timeOm Nom isnt yet sure where to start his walk from but he definitely wants  to start walking at time 0 at an upper row cell of the field it is guaranteed that the cells in this row do not contain any spiders  to walk by moving down the field towards the lowest row the walk ends when Om Nom leaves the boundaries of the park We know that Om Nom moves by jumping One jump takes one time unit and transports the little monster from his cell to either a sideadjacent cell on the lower row or outside the park boundariesEach time Om Nom lands in a cell he sees all the spiders that have come to that cell at this moment of time Om Nom wants to choose the optimal cell to start the walk from Thats why he wonders for each possible starting cell how many spiders will he see during the walk if he starts from this cell Help him and calculate the required value for each possible starting cell
