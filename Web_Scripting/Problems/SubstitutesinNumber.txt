Andrew and Eugene are playing a game Initially Andrew has string s consisting of digits Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type diti that means replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti For example if s123123 then query 200 transforms s to 10031003 and query 3 replace 3 by an empty string transforms it to s1212 After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 10000000071097 When you represent s as a decimal number please ignore the leading zeroes also if s is an empty string then its assumed that the number equals to zeroAndrew got tired of processing Eugenes requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that Help him
