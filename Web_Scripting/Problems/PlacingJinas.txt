We say an infinite sequence a_{0}, a_{1}, a_2, \ldots is non-increasing if and only if for all i\ge 0, a_i \ge a_{i+1}.There is an infinite right and down grid. The upper-left cell has coordinates (0,0). Rows are numbered 0 to infinity from top to bottom, columns are numbered from 0 to infinity from left to right.There is also a non-increasing infinite sequence a_{0}, a_{1}, a_2, \ldots. You are given a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n; for all i>n, a_i=0. For every pair of x, y, the cell with coordinates (x,y) (which is located at the intersection of x-th row and y-th column) is white if y<a_x and black otherwise.Initially there is one doll named Jina on (0,0). You can do the following operation.  Select one doll on (x,y). Remove it and place a doll on (x,y+1) and place a doll on (x+1,y). Note that multiple dolls can be present at a cell at the same time; in one operation, you remove only one. Your goal is to make all white cells contain 0 dolls.What's the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the goal? Print the answer modulo 10^9+7.
