Let's call a triple of positive integers (a, b, n) strange if the equality \frac{an}{nb} = \frac{a}{b} holds, where an is the concatenation of a and n and nb is the concatenation of n and b. For the purpose of concatenation, the integers are considered without leading zeroes.For example, if a = 1, b = 5 and n = 9, then the triple is strange, because \frac{19}{95} = \frac{1}{5}. But a = 7, b = 3 and n = 11 is not strange, because \frac{711}{113} \ne \frac{7}{3}.You are given three integers A, B and N. Calculate the number of strange triples (a, b, n), such that 1 \le a < A, 1 \le b < B and 1 \le n < N.
