This is an interactive problem.Kira has a hidden positive integer n, and Hayato needs to guess it.Initially, Kira gives Hayato the value \mathrm{cnt} — the number of unit bits in the binary notation of n. To guess n, Hayato can only do operations of one kind: choose an integer x and subtract it from n. Note that after each operation, the number n changes. Kira doesn't like bad requests, so if Hayato tries to subtract a number x greater than n, he will lose to Kira. After each operation, Kira gives Hayato the updated value \mathrm{cnt} — the number of unit bits in the binary notation of the updated value of n.Kira doesn't have much patience, so Hayato must guess the original value of n after no more than 30 operations.Since Hayato is in elementary school, he asks for your help. Write a program that guesses the number n. Kira is an honest person, so he chooses the initial number n before all operations and does not change it afterward.
