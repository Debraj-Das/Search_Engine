You are given two integers a and b.In one move, you can choose some integer k from 1 to 10 and add it to a or subtract it from a. In other words, you choose an integer k \in [1; 10] and perform a := a + k or a := a - k. You may use different values of k in different moves.Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain b from a.You have to answer t independent test cases.
