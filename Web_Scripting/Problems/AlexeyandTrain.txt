Alexey is travelling on a train. Unfortunately, due to the bad weather, the train moves slower that it should!Alexey took the train at the railroad terminal. Let's say that the train starts from the terminal at the moment 0. Also, let's say that the train will visit n stations numbered from 1 to n along its way, and that Alexey destination is the station n.Alexey learned from the train schedule n integer pairs (a_i, b_i) where a_i is the expected time of train's arrival at the i-th station and b_i is the expected time of departure.Also, using all information he has, Alexey was able to calculate n integers tm_1, tm_2, \dots, tm_n where tm_i is the extra time the train need to travel from the station i - 1 to the station i. Formally, the train needs exactly a_i - b_{i-1} + tm_i time to travel from station i - 1 to station i (if i = 1 then b_0 is the moment the train leave the terminal, and it's equal to 0).The train leaves the station i, if both conditions are met:   it's on the station for at least \left\lceil \frac{b_i - a_i}{2} \right\rceil units of time (division with ceiling);  current time \ge b_i. Since Alexey spent all his energy on prediction of time delays, help him to calculate the time of arrival at the station n.
