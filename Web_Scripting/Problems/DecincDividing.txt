Let's call an array a of m integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m Decinc if a can be made increasing by removing a decreasing subsequence (possibly empty) from it. For example, if a = [3, 2, 4, 1, 5], we can remove the decreasing subsequence [a_1, a_4] from a and obtain a = [2, 4, 5], which is increasing.You are given a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n. Find the number of pairs of integers (l, r) with 1 \le l \le r \le n such that p[l \ldots r] (the subarray of p from l to r) is a Decinc array.
