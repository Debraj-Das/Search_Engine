Imagine that Alice is playing a card game with her friend Bob. They both have exactly 8 cards and there is an integer on each card, ranging from 0 to 4. In each round, Alice or Bob in turns choose two cards from different players, let them be a and b, where a is the number on the player's card, and b is the number on the opponent's card. It is necessary that a \cdot b \ne 0. Then they calculate c = (a + b) \bmod 5 and replace the number a with c. The player who ends up with numbers on all 8 cards being 0, wins.Now Alice wants to know who wins in some situations. She will give you her cards' numbers, Bob's cards' numbers and the person playing the first round. Your task is to determine who wins if both of them choose the best operation in their rounds.
