Naruto has sneaked into the Orochimaru's lair and is now looking for Sasuke. There are T rooms there. Every room has a door into it, each door can be described by the number n of seals on it and their integer energies a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. All energies a_i are nonzero and do not exceed 100 by absolute value. Also, n is even.In order to open a door, Naruto must find such n seals with integer energies b_1, b_2, ..., b_n that the following equality holds: a_{1} \cdot b_{1} + a_{2} \cdot b_{2} + ... + a_{n} \cdot b_{n} = 0. All b_i must be nonzero as well as a_i are, and also must not exceed 100 by absolute value. Please find required seals for every room there.
