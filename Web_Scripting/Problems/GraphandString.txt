One day student Vasya was sitting on a lecture and mentioned a string s1s2 sn consisting of letters a b and c that was written on his desk As the lecture was boring Vasya decided to complete the picture by composing a graph G with the following properties   G has exactly n vertices numbered from 1 to n  For all pairs of vertices i and j where ij there is an edge connecting them if and only if characters si and sj are either equal or neighbouring in the alphabet That is letters in pairs ab and bc are neighbouring while letters ac are not Vasya painted the resulting graph near the string and then erased the string Next day Vasyas friend Petya came to a lecture and found some graph at his desk He had heard of Vasyas adventure and now he wants to find out whether it could be the original graph G painted by Vasya In order to verify this Petya needs to know whether there exists a string s such that if Vasya used this s he would produce the given graph G
