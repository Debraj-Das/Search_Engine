Let's define S(x) to be the sum of digits of number x written in decimal system. For example, S(5) = 5, S(10) = 1, S(322) = 7.We will call an integer x interesting if S(x + 1) < S(x). In each test you will be given one integer n. Your task is to calculate the number of integers x such that 1 \le x \le n and x is interesting.
