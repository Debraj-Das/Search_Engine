Let's define the cost of a string s as the number of index pairs i and j (1 \le i < j < |s|) such that s_i = s_j and s_{i+1} = s_{j+1}.You are given two positive integers n and k. Among all strings with length n that contain only the first k characters of the Latin alphabet, find a string with minimum possible cost. If there are multiple such strings with minimum cost — find any of them.
