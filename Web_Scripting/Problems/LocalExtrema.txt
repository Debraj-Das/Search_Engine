You are given an array a Some element of this array ai is a local minimum iff it is strictly less than both of its neighbours that is aiai1 and aiai1 Also the element can be called local maximum iff it is strictly greater than its neighbours that is aiai1 and aiai1 Since a1 and an have only one neighbour each they are neither local minima nor local maximaAn element is called a local extremum iff it is either local maximum or local minimum Your task is to calculate the number of local extrema in the given array
