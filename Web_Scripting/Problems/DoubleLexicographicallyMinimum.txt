You are given a string s. You can reorder the characters to form a string t. Define t_{\mathrm{max}} to be the lexicographical maximum of t and t in reverse order.Given s determine the lexicographically minimum value of t_{\mathrm{max}} over all reorderings t of s.A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds:   a is a prefix of b, but a \ne b;  in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
