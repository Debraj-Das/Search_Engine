Jeff loves regular bracket sequences.Today Jeff is going to take a piece of paper and write out the regular bracket sequence, consisting of nm brackets. Let's number all brackets of this sequence from 0 to nm - 1 from left to right. Jeff knows that he is going to spend ai mod n liters of ink on the i-th bracket of the sequence if he paints it opened and bi mod n liters if he paints it closed.You've got sequences a, b and numbers n, m. What minimum amount of ink will Jeff need to paint a regular bracket sequence of length nm?Operation x mod y means taking the remainder after dividing number x by number y.
