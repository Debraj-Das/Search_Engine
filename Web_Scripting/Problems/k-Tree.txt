Quite recently a creative student Lesha had a lecture on trees After the lecture Lesha was inspired and came up with the tree of his own which he called a ktreeA ktree is an infinite rooted tree where  each vertex has exactly k children  each edge has some weight  if we look at the edges that goes from some vertex to its children exactly k edges then their weights will equal 123k The picture below shows a part of a 3tree      As soon as Dima a good friend of Lesha found out about the tree he immediately wondered How many paths of total weight n the sum of all weights of the edges in the path are there starting from the root of a ktree and also containing at least one edge of weight at least dHelp Dima find an answer to his question As the number of ways can be rather large print it modulo 1000000007 1097
